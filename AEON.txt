                                     SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT

INTRODUCTION

This report covers AEON CO. (M) BHD. (AEON)’s sustainability initiatives and practices, community engagement and activities
and reporting of sustainability performance for the calendar year 2017.

We endeavour to move towards establishing an indicator to track and measure our achievement, in our continuous sustainability
journey, with the aim to create sustainable value economically, environmentally and socially alongside our pursuit of business
growth and long term value creation for stakeholders.

This is our second Sustainability reporting, thus we have gradually realign our approach in accordance to Bursa Malaysia
Securities Berhad’s Sustainability Reporting Guide and started tracking the progress and performance of our sustainability
initiatives partly using our Risk Control and Self-Assessment (RCSA) tool to consolidate our internal control system following
the sustainability plans.

In 2016, AEON reported its first Sustainability Statement based on three (3) pillars; Economic, Environment and Social (EES).
This year in order to build a sustainable society with our stakeholders, we realign our approach and incorporate the elements
of EES into our AEON Basic Principles represented by the four (4) prime pillars below.

AEON Sustainability focuses on these 4 pillars, which are defined as:-




Peace            AEON is a group whose operations are dedicated to the pursuit of peace through prosperity.

People           AEON respects human dignity and values personal relationships. Our people are our assets.

Community        AEON rooted in local community life and dedicated to making a continuing contribution to the community.

Customer         AEON practices its “Customer First” philosophy with its ever-lasting innovative spirit.


SCOPE

This report covers the reporting period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. It covers the operations AEON carried out
along with our AEON Basic Principles. This statement includes information on material sustainability issues as well as impacts

GOVERNANCE




                                                BOARD OF DIRECTORS




                                 Audit and Risk Management Committee




                                     Sustainability Working Committee
                                     (members from business units/departments)



As set out in the Board Charter, the Board of Directors (Board) is responsible for reviewing and adopting the overall corporate
strategy, plans and directions for the Company, including those related to sustainability. This is also in line with the expectation
outlined in the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance.

To assist the Board in driving and reporting the Company’s sustainability practice, the Company established the Sustainability
Working Committee (SWC) to ensure sustainability continues to be embedded in the Company’s business strategy and operation.
The SWC is chaired by the Executive Director of Corporate Management and coordinated by the Risk & Crisis Management
Department (Risk Management) in collaboration with committee members comprising Senior Management and relevant Heads
of Business Units / Departments from Finance & Accounting, Human Resource (HR), Corporate Communication (CC) and
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Customer Service, Administration, Quality Management (QM), Facility Management
and Safety.

The Executive Director, supported by the SWC, implements the strategic plan, policies and decisions by the Board to achieve
the Company’s objective of creating long-term value for its shareholders through, among of others, excelling in customer
service and providing sustainable best-in-industry performance in retail, community, reputation and environmental impact.



MATERIALITY PROCESS

Upon establishment of our governance structure, AEON has developed the Sustainability Policy and created the framework,
process, procedures and structured approach to identify and assess the materiality of the sustainability matters. The Company
recognises communication with stakeholders is imperative in understanding stakeholders’ expectation and concerns on the
sustainability matters. The Company basically frames its materiality process and analysis into three (3) steps process:


           STEP 1                    •   Set up Sustainability Working Committee
                                     •   Identification and revisit material matters

           STEP 2                    •   Analysis and assessment of material matters

           STEP 3                    •   Review




                                                                                                                                29

Step 1:	Identification of Materiality
         Continuing from AEON Sustainability Statement 2016, we revisited on the material sustainable matters highlighted
         to determine the relevant material sustainable matters for year 2017.

              For 2017, the materiality identification and development are based on internal and external factors including
              operating and retail industry environment. Following the identification process, we arrived at a list of thirteen
              (13) sustainable material matters categorised into the four (4) pillars.

Step 2:	Analysis and Assessment of Material Matters
         The Company carried out assessments to gauge the perception of stakeholders on the level of significance of
         each relevant sustainability matter.

	Stakeholder Engagement
  We value the views of our stakeholders and interact with them through various platforms, either formal or
  informal engagements, to help the Company keep up-to date with the concerns and issues of stakeholders,

AEON’s reforestation and habitat preservation initiatives under its AEON Cares programme aim to promote healthy and
interactive green activities with communities. At the same time, the initiatives help to create environmental awareness and
instill greater social responsibility among Malaysians, especially the younger generation.

The activities undertaken by AEON Cares are monitored, with advice and assistance from the Forest Research Institute
Malaysia (FRIM), with whom it had a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to accomplish several initiatives and projects to
protect our environment and biodiversity.



Malaysian Japan Friendship Forest @ Paya Indah Wetland, Selangor

As at 2017, AEON has planted more than 60,260 trees at Paya Indah Wetland to sustain the natural habitats and biodiversity
as part of our heritage.




From 2015 to 2017, AEON has invested approximately RM180,000, at an average RM60,000 per year for the maintenance
of the trees including fertilizing, pruning and weeding to allow their healthy growth. The site received close supervision and
monitoring from FRIM experts.



AEON Forest Tree Diversity Planting Programme – Bidor, Perak

This project started in 2014 to mark AEON’s 30th Anniversary and its commitment to rehabilitate and reforest the ex-tin mine
land to preserve the biodiversity.

AEON has planted a total of approximately 8,000 trees at Bidor, Perak with the help from 1,010 volunteers. The area after 3
years of maintenance by AEON at an average annual maintenance cost of RM192,000 per year is now ready to be handed

AEON Hometown Forest Programme has become AEON’s tradition and culture since 1991. Our aim is to always plant new
trees at the compound and the surrounding of our newly built AEON shopping malls. It is an activity AEON always carried out
together with the local community and school children besides other stakeholders. It allows AEON to continuously promote a
green and healthy living society and to develop long lasting relationship with the local community in which it operates.




As at 2017, AEON has planted over half a million trees in Malaysia. On 5 August 2017, to mark the opening of our AEON Mall

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

As one of the established retailers in Malaysia which operate 34 stores and 26 shopping malls, AEON took seriously its role
in managing energy and resources effectively and efficiently, to reduce carbon footprint in its daily operations and to support
and protect our environment.

Electricity Savings

AEON has implemented several self-initiated guidelines and best practices at its Shopping Malls, Stores and head office in
order to manage carbon footprint and reduce CO2 emissions from the sources of energy consumption such as air conditioning
and lighting.

A guideline is set by the Facility Department for operation to manage and control the air-conditioning temperature at AEON’s
Shopping Malls. The operation maintenance team at the respective Shopping Malls will then utilise a standard checklist
prepared by the Facility Department for daily checking, monitoring and controlling the usage. An increase of 1 degree Celsius
in air-conditioning temperature will have a significant impact in the electricity savings of 600 kwh/daily.

Besides controlling the air-conditioning temperature, AEON is also committed to promote energy efficiency by replacing
conventional lighting to LED lighting at its Stores, Shopping Malls and Head office. This initiative proved to reduce electricity
consumption and their usage proved to last longer than the conventional lighting.

In 2017, AEON has managed to save monthly electricity charges (excluding AEON Mall and Store Bandar Dato’ Onn) of
approximately RM24,000 per month and RM288,000 per year (equivalent to 823,000 kWH per month and 9.876 mil kWH per year).

AEON has completed in its malls and stores about 98% of the LED replacement initiatives and efforts are ongoing in 2018 to
complete 100% installation, which includes the parking areas.

Foster High Performance Culture

AEON adopted a computerised system of Performance Management System (PMS) in 2014/2015 to transform the “old school”
method of manual operation into an effective and efficient system-based functional tool for all AEON employees.


                                                          A system known as the “Success Factor” is currently being used featuring
                                                          several functional tools that integrate the employees’ Key Performance
                                                          Indicators (KPIs), performance review, performance evaluation and
                                                          calibration into one system process. This allows the Human Resource

                                                          The calibration process was further enhanced in 2017 that enable human

AEON fully abide and continuously seek to always comply with labour laws of Malaysia as well as other regulations such as
National Minimum Wage Policy and Minimum Age Employment guideline in Malaysia.

AEON has in place its established AEON Code of Conduct (ACOC) which is an internal whistle-blowing mechanism that helps
employees to raise and highlight their concerns regarding illegal or unethical conduct or malpractice at workplace.

In August 2017, AEON Human Resource Department launched the ACOC new awareness card for all AEON people, clearly
defining the procedure for employees to channel their voices or concerns to the related appointed personnel. All employees
were to attach the card together with their employee identity card.

malls with the support from Safety Department, the Emergency Response Team (ERT) at Operations level and assistance from
the local Fire Department (Bomba) of the respective regions.

Simplified and Effective Process

Moving forward, we plan to switch our current assessment method to Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI), a new mechanism
for us to evaluate our customer service performance. CSI provides a more holistic result to measure our customer service
standard with more number of customer samplings. It will be able to provide an accurate measure to our customer’s loyalty
and identify areas of improvements.

In order to increase automation of our services to customers, AEON focus on upgrading its consumer interaction technology.
In 2017, installation of new POS Q5 System cash registers was completed. The new cash register with enhanced speed allows
our cashiers to complete customer transactions with greater efficiency and convenience. A total of 1,422 new cash registers
with touch screen panel was installed.
