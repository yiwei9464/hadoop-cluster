Most recently, Malaysia has started engaging with all segments of society at an unprecedented scale in preparation for the
new national aspiration vision (2020-2050), Transformasi Nasional 2050 (TN50). This overarching vision of making Malaysia
a top 20 nation in economic development, social advancement and innovation is another advancement towards achieving
the UNSDGs.

Sunway and Malaysia as a whole have made significant progress on all UNSDGs. As one of Malaysia’s largest conglomerates
with 12 business divisions, we have invested millions of Ringgit in realising these goals.

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE
The Sunway Sustainability Task Force reports to the Board of Directors on Economic,
Environmental, Social and Governance (EESG) matters. ESG matters that are material to
value creation are integrated into our balanced scorecard, which is used to set objectives,
drive behaviours, measure performance and determine remuneration.

Tan Sri Dr Jeffrey Cheah AO, Founder and Chairman of Sunway Group, heads the Group
Executive Committee (EXCO). Sunway Sustainability Taskforce oversees the execution of
Sunway’s sustainable strategy in the day-to-day operations.

Sunway Sustainability Taskforce comprises representatives from key functions including
operations, planning, social and business. The taskforce acts as the thinker and planner
of Sunway’s sustainable development projects. It is responsible for developing Sunway’s
overarching sustainability framework, setting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and targets
in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, and driving sustainability initiatives across
the Group. This in turn informs the Board’s strategic planning especially in monitoring
EESG risks and opportunities. The taskforce meets regularly and provides updates to the
Group EXCO.

diesel
Euro5 Diesel is a technologically-advanced fuel with zero
emissions for a sustainable and cleaner environment. Euro5
Diesel costs an additional RM 0.10/litre compared to
normal diesel. However, it is better for the environment
and vehicle maintenance.


      ENVIRONMENTAL
  BENEFITS OF EURO5 DIESEL




• Improved engine performance for acceleration
  from cleaner fuel injectors
• Reduced ignition delay enhancing cold start
  performance for complete combustion for
  maximum power
• Better fuel economy
• Increased protection against engine corrosion



In November 2017, Tan Sri Dr Jeffrey Cheah AO advised all
Sunway Petrol Card holders, who drive diesel cars, and all
Sunway diesel vehicles, to use Euro5 Diesel with immediate
effect. This instruction is in line with Sunway’s commitment
to the UNSDGs.

  Sunway Property supported Penang Municipal Council of Seberang Perai (MPSP) by
contributing 300 Tecoma trees to Bandar Perda, Seberang Perai. The tree planting event
        was held in conjunction with Malaysia’s 60th National Day on 27 August.
On 11 November, Sunway Property planted 135 trees in ‘The Most Number of Amenity
Trees Planted within 24 Hours’ event organised by Penang Island City Council (MBPP).
  The trees were planted at Sunway Cassia and Sunway Valley City. Employees, family
    members and friends joined forces to make Penang a greener and liveable city.

Waste segregatiOn and dispOsal systeM
We implement a separate waste management system for dry, wet and recyclable wastes.

e-Waste ManageMent
Sunway holds an annual e-Waste Disposal Campaign. Electronic gadgets such as mobile
phones, batteries, chargers and other electronic components belonging to employees
and students (at Monash University and Sunway University) are disposed of in e-Waste
collection bins placed in strategic locations.




                                          54 | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017
CliniCal Waste
Sunway Medical Centre segregates clinical waste where it is disposed of in yellow step-bins which are collected several
times each day and are wheeled to the interim Clinical Waste Storage Chamber. They are collected by a licensed
contractor and transported to the incineration plant. A clinical waste summary collection report, along with copies of all
consignment notes for the month, is sent to Selangor State Department of Environment as per regulations.


          WHAT HAPPENS ONCE OUR CLINICAL WASTE HAS
          BEEN COLLECTED BY A LICENSED CONTRACTOR?
Clinical waste arriving at the incineration plant is weighed before being transferred for disposal. Bins are unloaded into
a hopper and cleaned for reuse. The waste is incinerated at over 1,000°C, which is gradually reduced to 280°C in the
quenching system and 200°C by the air preheater. The flue gas is passed through a mixture of lime and activated carbon
prior to entering the multi-cyclone and filter bag house. The clean flue gas is extracted by an Induced Draft Fan and passed
through a 15-metre stack. This process is monitored in real time using a Continuous Emission Monitoring System as
required by the Department of Environment.




                    Daily collection of Clinical Waste from wards in lockable wheeled bins




                                 Daily wastes are collected, weighed and kept in
                                 Sunway Medical Centre’s clinical waste storage




                    Dedicated trucks collect clinical waste from Sunway Medical Centre
                                  and deliver it to the incineration plant




                               Received clinical waste is weighed to check it is the
                                   same as that despatched from the hospital




                                       Clinical waste is sent for incineration

Recyclable Waste
Recyclable waste separation is practised in all Sunway properties. Recyclable bins are placed in public common areas or
back-of-house.


        What Happens Once Our Scheduled Waste
      Has Been Collected by a Licensed Contractor?

                             Sunway adheres to the waste packaging and labelling
                             requirements set by the Department of Environment




       When our scheduled waste arrives at the incinerator plant, the trucks and their contents
      are weighed. A waste inspection and sampling team inspects and takes samples of the waste.




               The waste containers are bar-coded. Following laboratory analysis, the waste
               consignment is transferred to temporary storage for treatment or disposal.




        The Incineration Plant ensures a thermal destruction efficiency of 99.9999%, which meets
       DOE licensing conditions for incineration emissions. Scheduled wastes are incinerated and
       transformed into carbon dioxide, water vapour, hydrogen chloride gas, sulphur dioxide gas,
                                             slag and fly ash.




               Inorganic liquid wastes such as spent acid and alkaline, chromate and cyanide
                    wastes are treated in the Physical/Chemical Treatment (PCT) Plant.




        The solidification/stablisation plant continues the process of rendering the treated waste
        from the Physical/Chemical Treatment (PCT) Plant and other processes by solidifying the
                       waste via fixation before being disposed of in secured landfill.

In September 2015, world leaders gathered at a special United Nations summit in New York to adopt Agenda
2030 and commit to 17 Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs). These goals provide a holistic framework
   with the vision of eradicating poverty and deprivation, growing economies, protecting the environment,
                               advancing peace and promoting good governance.

     Sunway is committed to the UNSDGs and aims to attain recognition and distinction in advancing
                                        them in the region.

              Climate change, global warming, the changing environment, urbanisation and population growth.
 While cities occupy merely 3% of all land, they consume 60% to 80% of energy and emit 70% of greenhouse gases.

Facing this challenge, we must find a path towards progress that meets the demands of our global community without
                             disturbing the ecological equilibrium that sustains our planet.
