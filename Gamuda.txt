Introduction to 
Sustainability 
Sustainable and inclusive development continue to 
be our core focus in order to remain resilient in 
today's dynamic business landscape. To future-proof 
our business and create inclusive economic growth 
for all stakeholders, we continuously refine our 
strategic alignment with the National Development 
Plan, tap on future market trends and strive to be 
the forerunner in innovative construction technologies 
and customer solutions. 
This year, we further integrate the principles of 
sustainability across our businesses by delivering value 
through innovation, building sustainable cities and 
communities while developing our human capital. Our 
initiatives aim to achieve broader value creation for 
our key stakeholders, while aligning ourselves to the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. 
04 Sustainability 
r. 
Our leading track record in infrastructure construction 
is a testament to our capable human capital, which 
we have nurtured in our many construction projects. 
Echoing the 11th Malaysia Plan of strengthening human 
capital, it remains our priority to develop a multi-skilled 
local workforce with competitive expertise in underground 
construction work and high technology construction. 
We embrace the circular economy by taking advantage 
of our ability to maximise our resources and minimise 
our environmental footprint, using novel processes afforded 
by technology. Our sustainable township development is 
underpinned by holistic environmental planning, which 
integrates the ecosystem and land use planning to connect 
our local communities with nature and improve liveability. 
We are officially the first developer in Malaysia to publicly 
pledge biodiversity audits for our new townships. 
Moving forward, we believe that our sustainability 
strategy, human capital development and focus on 
innovation will underpin our growth in the region.

or 
DURING THE YEAR, WE ENHANCED OUR SUSTAINABILITY AGENDA BY DEVELOPING A 
SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK (THE FRAMEWORK), WHICH FOCUSES ON THE 3C'S OF OUR 
CORPORATE STRATEGY, NAMELY CAPACITY, CAPABILITY AND COMPETITIVENESS. THE 
3C'S ALIGN OUR FOCUS TOWARDS DRIVING SUSTAINABLE GROWTH AND ULTIMATELY 
ACHIEVING OUR VISION AND MISSION. 
Within the Framework, initiatives to manage our 18 material matters have been categorised according to their 
impact on the Sustainability Pillars of Economic Growth, Environmental Management and Social Contribution. 
Our initiatives are shaped by the targets in place for high priority material matters to achieve sustainability 
goals. These initiatives reflect the greater call by the United Nations to achieve sustainable development globally 
through the 17 SDGs. 
Driving the entire Framework are our five core values that have helped us develop into the leading infrastructure 
and construction organisation that we are today. These values are further outlined in our Value Creation 
Strategy, on page 20 to 21 of this Annual Report. Adherence to these values, as well as with our Code of Ethics 
and Business Conduct and Whistleblowing Policy, ensures all our operations and dealings are conducted 
ethically.

Materiality assessment provides the foundation of our sustainability direction, determining matters that have 
significant economic, environmental and social (EES) impacts on the Group and those that are considered 
important to our stakeholders. 
MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 
In 2018, we set out to refine and improve our approach towards sustainability reporting. We engaged an external 
consultant to conduct a materiality assessment workshop to prioritise our EES matters. Our materiality 
assessment involved a structured process comprising the four steps below:

boundaries. 
A list of sustainability matters were identified from Bursa 
Malaysia Sustainability Reporting Guide, GRI Standards, desktop 
research, best practices, media reviews and other internal and 
external sources. 
A materiality assessment workshop was conducted with senior 
management of the Group to prioritise the sustainability matters 
through a voting session. 
The senior management were also required to identify the key 
stakeholders to the Group. Kindly refer to pages 69 to 70 for 
more details on our stakeholder engagement. 
The materiality matrix generated from the workshop was 
validated by the business division heads and presented to the 
Group's Managing Director for approval. 
The Board of Directors is updated regularly on our sustainability 
journey.

ISO certification is a quality management system standard. Gamuda Berhad, Gamuda 
Engineering and Gamuda Land is ISO 9001 Quality Management System certified and 
has recently achieved ISO 9001:2015 standard. The Group has also achieved the ISO 
14001 Environmental Management System and the OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health 
and Safety Management System. 
Quality Assessment System in Construction (QI-ASSIC) is used by Construction Industry 
Development Board (CIDB) to evaluate the workmanship of a building's construction 
based on the Construction Industry Standard (CIS7:2014). 
Table 3: Best-in-Class Standards 
The value that we created year-on-year, through mindful planning has resulted in capital appreciation for our 
developments as attested by The Edge and The Association of Valuers, Property Managers, Estate Agent and Property 
Consultants in the Private Sectors Malaysia (PEPS) in the yearly The Edge-PEPS Value Creation Excellence Award. 
Gamuda Land has been the recipient of this award for 6 consecutive years, the only developer in the country to 
have achieved this feat.

Responsive Complaint Management System (CMS) 
The Group has established among the most responsive 
and effective CMS for large-scale infrastructure projects 
in Malaysia. The CMS functions not only as a tool to 
gauge public satisfaction, but it is also used to evaluate 
Work Package Contractors' (WPCs) quality of work as 
well as their ability to identify and rectify potential 
safety, health and environmental risks at our current 
KVMRT Line I and Line 2 worksites. 
As the CMS works on real-time monitoring, it allows 
for quicker response and effective management of 
complaints, which eventually improves our overall 
performance and relationship with all affected 
stakeholders.

Supplier Management 
We build fair, ethical and lasting relationships with our 
suppliers. We have an assessment system to ensure 
our suppliers comply with local as well as international 
management system standard such as ISO 9001, 
ISO 14001, MS 1722 and OHSAS 18001. our suppliers' 
performance is monitored through regular 
Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) inspection, 
independent monthly audits and an online SHE Reporting 
System - Safetrack (that is used in KVMRT Line I 
and Line 2). 
We emphasise on training and mentoring our suppliers 
to enhance their competency and competitiveness in 
the marketplace. Suppliers are invited to participate 
in related training programmes such as BIM and other 
operational efficiency related programmes. 
As the PDP of the KVMRT Line 1 and Line 2, one of 
our primary roles is to manage the procurement process 
for all construction work packages jointly with the 
Government. Given that KVMRT Line 1 and Line 2 
represent the largest infrastructure undertaking in the 
country to date, we have made a conscious effort to 
award as many packages as possible to local companies. 
In addition, we source our raw materials from local 
supply chain, boosting the local economy. 
Work on the KVMRT Line 1 and Line 2 does not merely 
benefit local small and medium enterprise (SMEs) 
financially, but also increases their technical competency 
and capabilities, through the experience gained from 
underground tunnelling works which employ the latest, 
cutting edge systems. In addition, local companies 
stand to benefit from heightened awareness of best 
safety practices, and the ability to comply with the 
highest safety standards as a result of training provided 
through the KVMRT Training Centre, in collaboration 
with CIDB.

Industrialised Building System (IBS) 
IBS represents an advanced digital construction 
technology through which building components are 
prefabricated at a factory. It utilises an integrated BIM 
design which thrives on a Common Data Environment 
(CDE) that allows the sharing of integrated data among 
the project team during the entire construction process. 
IBS encourages the adoption of long-term design 
thinking, technology and innovation throughout the life 
cycle of a construction project. 
We are the first engineering and construction organisation 
in Malaysia to have constructed a fully robotic IBS 
factory. Our first IBS factory in Sepang commenced 
operations on 15 June 2016. A second IBS factory is 
being constructed in Banting which will be ready by end 
2018. Our investment in the two fully integrated digital 
IBS factories has allowed us to transition from the 
conventional construction method to a digital building 
system where components are prefabricated in a 
controlled environment and moved to the building site 
for installation. 
As at July 2018, some 1,800 apartment units have been 
completed using our digital IBS. By the end of 2018. our 
IBS factories will have a combined capacity to produce 
8,000 property units per year. 
All Gamuda Land's high-rise developments will be fully 
designed using BIM and digital IBS by 2020, following 
which the innovative systems will be expanded to other 
property segments. Our digitally integrated system will 
enable us to deliver buildings in all market segments 
with the same superior quality, be it affordable homes 
or luxury developments.

Building Information Modelling (BIM) 
Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a computerised 
system that integrates multi-stakeholder coordination 
while allowing for greater precision and speed in the 
design and implementation of projects. It functions as 
a platform with real-time access to all design information 
coupled with 3-D visualisation and animated 
walkthroughs. 
We believe the implementation of BIM will enhance 
our competitiveness in the market by delivering 
innovative design and construction solutions.

Sustainability Statement (Cont'd.) 
Enhancing Biodiversity through Gamuda Parks 
Conscious efforts to design a township that reflects 
its natural surroundings encourage people to explore 
the outdoors and take part in activities together with 
family and friends for a healthier lifestyle. With this in 
mind, in 2018 we established Gamuda Parks in 
collaboration with Wetland International Malaysia and 
Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM). 
Its main role is to monitor and coordinate measures 
to protect the biodiversity within a development while 
implementing design and maintenance standards to 
enhance the quality of living. In carrying out its function, 
Gamuda Parks takes into consideration three ecosystems 
which is softscape, waterscape, materials and resources. 
Improving Green Spaces 
Green spaces are integral to creating a holistic sense 
of well-being and providing natural habitats for wildlife 
that helps to conserve biodiversity. In designing our 
landscapes, our green coverage exceeds the minimum 
requirement of 10%. 
Tree Planting Programme 
Advanced Tree Planting (ATR) 
ATR involves the procurement of standard-sized young 
trees measuring 50mm to 75mm in diameter, nurturing 
them in an in-house nursery for at least two years 
before planting on site. We ensure an optimum mix of 
different plant species, including those that are native 
to the particular environment, in order to enhance the 
local ecosystem. ATR has been carried out in Gamuda 
Gardens, Gamuda Cove and Kundang Estates. Since 
2016, we planted nearly 5,000 trees. 
Retention Lakes and Ponds Design 
Gamuda Land townships are well known for their parks 
and lakescapes. While these form part of planning 
compliance and play an important role in flood mitigation 
that is part of the Urban Stormwater Management 
Manual (MSMA), we sought to creatively transform this 
utilitarian necessity into unique landscape features that 
will be integral to the community. 
Jade Hills, Kota Kemuning and Valencia are testaments 
of good masterplan designs which won numerous 
awards such as the Gold Award in Infrastructure 
Planning by the Singapore Institute of Planners.

Our Gamuda Parks Biodiversity Policy (GBP) outlines 
standards and guidelines for the management and 
maintenance of the softscape, waterscape, materials 
and resources to ensure the sustainability of our 
township developments. 
To enhance general awareness of the importance of 
biodiversity, we organised a public biodiversity workshop 
on 26 to 27 May 2018 across our towns and developments 
in various states. We have also carried out a biodiversity 
audit as a scientific measurement of liveability and 
habitability of the environment in Gamuda Gardens and 
Gamuda Cove, which will help us in our future targeted 
conservation measures.

landscaped green spaces including parks as well as 
97-acre of water features. In selecting the tree species 
to be planted, we will be guided by the surrounding 
forest and adjacent Paya Indah Wetlands. As they grow, 
these plants will support an increasingly broad range 
of birds, insects and butterflies that will enhance overall 
biodiversity.

town halls and regular engagements, we promote a sense of belonging while respecting our employees' work- 
life balance needs. 
Given the emphasis on employee retention, we have maintained a stable turnover rate, with Group attrition rate 
of 9% in FY2018. Our turnover rate for the past three years has been consistently below 10%, which is also below 
the industry average of 15%.

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT 
We keep our employees updated on 
corporate developments through 
newsletters, intranet, town hall meetings 
and Workplace by Facebook. We are able 
to maintain open, two-way dialogue and 
engender a feeling of connectedness among 
each other and with the Group.

We have launched GWEN this year to advance careers 
of women by providing a support network. GWEN aims 
to empower our women through a broader scope 
covering three pillars: Career Development, Engagement

We have kicked off the first initiative under GWEN that 
fine-tunes our existing mentorship programme by 
having a panel of external mentors in leadership 
positions from different sectors. 
Leadership Development 
We have adopted the Korn Ferry Hay Leadership Tool 
to measure current leadership style and future leadership 
potential within the organisation. The assessment has 
provided us a perspective to identify areas of improvement 
for succession planning and leadership development. 
In line with our effort to develop our leaders, two

namely "First-time Managers" and "Managerial Evolution' . 
Both programmes are designed to assist newly promoted 
managers as well as experienced managers to better 
transition into their new leadership roles.

Renew 
By •renewing' our talent, we seek to develop multi- 
skilled employees by encouraging exposure to a range 
of functions, which gives our people a competitive edge 
and enables the Group to stay dynamic in the industry. 
Career Development 
The Career Development Unit (CDU) has been set up 
to provide internal career guidance and coaching to 
enhance employees' competencies in current and future 
roles. The Strengths-Development-Opportunities-Career 
(SDOC) Staller tool is used to discover Gamudians' 
personal strengths and development needs. With this, 
employees are able to identify and map out individualised 
career development plans. 
Training and Capability Building 
Our in-house Gamuda Learning Centre (GLC), the 
Group's dedicated training arm utilises the career 
development plan to conduct Training Need Analysis. 
We provide skills-based and technical training for staff 
from all career levels and job streams. 
Skills-based Training 
The Construction Management Programme (CMP) was 
introduced to train our young site supervisors and 
engineers through real site work exposure. This annual 
programme focuses on internationally benchmarked 
construction skills adopted from best practices in 
Australia, Europe and Singapore. CMP courses are 
accredited by CIDB for Civil and Structural or Building 
and Architectural Works. 
Most of the eligible employees have undertaken the 
CMP training within two years since its launch in 2016. 
In F Y 2018, the trainees mostly are new hires and 
employees that have previously deferred their training.

HEALTH AND SAFETY 
We place health and safety as a top priority in our 
operations as we strive to safeguard all our employees, 
contractors, customers, suppliers, local communities, 
and other stakeholders. Steered by a robust Quality, 
Safety, Health and Environment (QSHE) management 
system, we strive to achieve zero fatality through 
continuous management, monitoring and improvement 
of the Group's health and safety performance. 
Safety and Health Management System 
Our safety and health policies outline the relevant 
processes and procedures to continuously improve the 
sustainability of our operations by providing high-quality, 
cost-effective, reliable. safe and environment-friendly 
services. Policy reviews are done regularly to ensure 
that they remain relevant, appropriate and aligned with 
our business objectives. 
The policies are supported by an effective management 
system to manage and continuously eliminate hazards 
and minimise safety and health risks. All our key 
business units have in place safety and health 
management systems that are certified to local and 
international standards. These certifications are renewed 
periodically to remain relevant with the latest industrial 
standards. For instance, Gamuda Berhad and Gamuda 
Engineering are certified by the Integrated Management 
System (IMS) which covers safety and health related 
standards, OHSAS 18001 :2007 Occupational Health and 
Safety, and MS 1722:2011 Occupational Safety and 
Health Management Systems. We are also currently 
transitioning to ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health 
and Safety Management System.

Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Determining 
Control 
As part of our safety and health management system 
requirements, all activities must undergo the Hazard 
Identification, Risk Assessment and Determining Control 
(HIRADC) process before the commencement of any 
project. 
All employees and workers shall promptly report all 
work-related hazards and hazardous situations 
encountered. Employees and workers shall remove 
themselves from work situations that may cause injury 
or ill health. Should they fear reprisals on account of 
their actions, they may report the matter directly to 
the Head of Project or SHE personnel for further 
investigation. Employees and workers shall discuss 
with their superiors to mitigate the risks before resuming 
work. 
Reported incidents will be handled in accordance with 
our Incident Investigation and Reporting procedures. 
Analysed data and trends compiled from these incidents 
are reviewed critically and used to enhance existing 
strategies and procedures.
