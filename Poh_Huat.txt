Annual Report 2018 
The Board is pleased to present this General Sustainability Statement ("Statement") which sets out what the Board considers 
as material sustainability risks and opportunities (collectively known as "Material Sustainability Matters or "MSM"") to the 
operations of the Group and how these Material Sustainability Matters are managed. 
As the scope of this Statement is primarily based on revenue contribution from operations according to geographical locations, 
namely operations in Malaysia and Vietnam. 
This Statement is prepared in accordance with the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad 
("Bursa Securities"), the Sustainability Reporting Guide and its accompanying Toolkits issued by Bursa. This Statement 
considers the economic, environmental and social implications the Group is exposed to in ensuring its business is carried out 
in a sustainable and responsible manner. 
Sustainability Governance Structure 
While the Board is primarily responsible for the Group's sustainability practices and performance, it is assisted by the RMC, 
which in turn is supported by the Executive Directors and Senior Management in managing sustainability-related matters. 
The RMC, a Board Committee which comprises a majority of Independent Directors, has an enhanced role, i.e. to incorporate 
sustainability considerations in the Group's business and management of economic, environmental and social risks and 
opportunities, in addition to its incumbent oversight responsibilities over the Group's risk management framework and 
processes. 
The RMC's responsibilities pertaining to the Group's sustainability framework and processes include the following: 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
establishment of the Group's sustainability framework; 
reviewing the adequacy of sustainability initiatives and processes; 
ensuring effectiveness of the process in identifying, assessing, managing and reporting Material Sustainability Matters 
("MSMs"); and 
monitoring and overseeing all sustainable strategies and initiatives of the Group. 
In carrying out its responsibilities on the Group's sustainability, the RMC is supported by the Executive Directors and Senior 
Management, who report to the RMC at least on an annual basis, on the assessment of the Group's sustainability framework 
and processes, and MSMs identified from time to time, including how these matters are managed. 
Material Sustainability Matters 
During the financial year and up to the date of this Statement, the Company has appointed an independent consultant to conduct 
a training and workshop session for the purpose of assisting the Group to identify sustainability matters that are considered 
material to its operations. Set out below is an overview of the MSMs of the Group and how they are managed according to 
economic, environmental and social aspects.

(a) 
(b) 
Economic 
In order to maintain and enhance Poh Huat's position as one the leading world class furniture manufacturers, it is crucial 
for the Group to be able to design and produce high quality innovative products. Poh Huat offers customers with products 
which are designed and manufactured using quality raw materials. 
In the design of its in-house office products, the Group's design philosophy is to create pleasant, productive office 
environment with well-designed office suites that integrate new office automation technology into the classic office 
environment. Poh Huat has a dedicated Research and Development team which collaborates with customers' designers 
in coming up with innovative designs for the Group's products. 
Poh Huat's products are often made up of comparatively premium materials, incorporating the latest functional and 
aesthetic trends. The Group's designs are regularly enhanced with new features and functionalities to accommodate new 
requirements of the diverse demographics and customers' preferences. 
As for its original equipment market ("OEM"), the Group works closely with customers at every stage of product 
development and production programme. In dealing with OEM customers, Poh Huat employs a service differentiation 
strategy that focuses on issues which are most important to the buyers, such as product features and designs, material 
and construction specifications, costing and pricing targets, and production scheduling and quality control requirements. 
Poh Huat places great emphasis on the delivery of quality products and services with the aim to create long-term and 
sustainable business relationships with customers. In this regard, the Group continuously emphasises on "Quality" and 
"Customer-focus", being watchwords that reflect the quality commitment of the Group towards its customers. 
Alongside its efforts to create and offer innovative products to customers, Poh Huat has undertaken measures to achieve 
and maintain quality in its products, including the establishment of a manufacturing process that ensures product quality 
standards, in-process quality control measures and final quality inspections. The manufacturing process accords with 
the principles of ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management Systems. 
The Group views customer service as an integral part of its product offering. Service to customer begins on first contact 
with potential customers and continues thereon with product review, selection and development, production programme 
co-ordination, quality control, warehousing shipment co-ordination and delivery, post-delivery services, etc. 
Environmental 
Apart from ensuring the quality of products and services, the Group also ensures compliance with the California Air 
Resources Board ("CARB") Airborne Toxic Control Measures ("ATCM") Phase II labelling requirements, which set the 
standards for formaldehyde emissions from composite wood products exported to the United States. Such labelling is 
one of the key requirements of the Group to enable it to continue selling to the United States market, which contributes to 
the bulk of the Group's revenue. Furthermore, the CARB requirements are closely followed by an enhanced requirement 
where the Group's sales to the United States are labelled as Toxic Substances Control Act ("TSCA") Title VI compliant. The 
Group has undertaken the necessary measures to ensure that its products sold to the United States are TSCA Title VI 
compliant, in order to maintain its market share and customer relationships in this market.
