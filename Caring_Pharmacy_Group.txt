     To identify the issues that are important to the CARiNG Group, we conducted our first materiality assessment, which
     was attended by our senior management team and Heads of Departments.

     The following steps were carried out to create our Materiality Matrix.

                                                                                         and opportunities arising from the EES impacts of the company’s business operations

                                                                                         to importance.


     Materiality Matrix

     In our materiality matrix, 14 aspects are identified and plotted as the most relevant items to CARiNG Group. The
     X-axis represents the significance of the organisation’s EES impacts, whereas the Y-axis denotes influences on
     stakeholder assessments, decisions or issues which are material to the stakeholders.

     the highest influence on our stakeholder’s decision.

sustainability and corporate
responsibility report

The CARiNG Group operates in a highly regulated business environment, and its activities are subject to numerous
laws, regulations and licensing conditions. As such, our stakeholders and CARiNG Group place great value in
governance and compliance, followed by product quality and affordable medicine in accordance with our vision and
mission.

Waste reduction and environmental protection are low in our priority, as our business activities and operations do
not generate significant wastes or emissions to warrant a considerable attention. Nevertheless, we implemented
initiatives to reduce emission and waste.

At CARiNG Group, we believe in practising constant engagement with organisations and/or people impacted by our

sustainability governance

The Board plays a vital guidance and oversight role in advancing sustainability across the organisation. The Board
receives regular updates on sustainability issues from our Group Managing Director and other members of senior
management.

Assisted by the senior management team, the Managing Director bears the highest responsibility of managing and
continually enhancing our EES sustainability direction at CARiNG Group.

Approved by the Board, the CARiNG Group Code of Conduct (COC) adheres to the highest standards of integrity
and behaviour of our employees. Our Whistle Blowing Policy (WPP) is disclosed on our website, and it provides
all stakeholders a direct channel for reporting instances of misconduct that contradict our COC and/or other non-

• Reduction and Efficiency

LED lighting uses twice as less than the energy consumed by fluorescent lighting, suggesting that LED lighting is a
cost-efficient and environmentally friendly alternative. Since 2014, new CARiNG Outlets have been fitted with LED
lighting to reduce the electricity consumption at the operational level.

A budget of RM 120,000 has been allocated for the transition of CARiNG Outlets that were opened before May 2014
from T5 to LED lighting. The initiative to switch to LED lighting is already 90% complete. By 2019, all CARiNG Outlets
are expected to be fitted exclusively with LED lighting.

To enhance energy efficiency, we have also prescribed the usage of energy-saving refrigerators and air-conditioning
units with inverter technology at the CARiNG Head Office and across all CARiNG Outlets.

                                                                                         CARiNG        CARiNG Head

• Smart Routing

The CARiNG Group has devised a programme with our logistics consultant to enhance the energy efficiency during
transportation by implementing route optimisation. Smart route planning not only reduces carbon emissions by
minimising the distance travelled per hour but also shortens delivery time and improves delivery efficiency.

Waste Management

The increasing production of wastes worldwide has exerted an unprecedented pressure on the planet. At the CARiNG
Group, we have created mechanisms for reducing and recycling the wastes that we generate.

• Plastic

Since 2008, we have worked towards reducing the plastic waste        10,000
