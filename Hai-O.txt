     LEADERSHIP FOR SUSTAINABILITY



                     Creating accountability and sound leadership to steer the
                              company towards greater sustainability

     The short, medium and long-term impact of a business on the economy, the environment and society at large is a key
     consideration in recognising its performance in terms of sustainability. Essentially, the focus goes beyond ﬁnancial
     performance and corporate social responsibility. In order to effectively manage and realise our commitment to integrate
     sustainability throughout our value chain, we have developed a governance structure as shown below. The Sustainability
     Steering Committee (“SSC”) is led by the Group Managing Director and the Group Executive Director. While the SSC
     comprises of the General Managers of our main business segments (i.e Wholesale, MLM and Retail), the Sustainability
     Working Committee (“SWC”) is made up of key personnel from business support units and general management.

     At the apex of the governance structure is the Board of Directors (“the Board”) and its key role is to endorse the Company’s
     sustainability strategy and commitment statement, as well as to issue ﬁnal approval of the sustainability report and its
     contents.

     The roles and responsibilities of the SSC and SWC are as follows:


                                                               SSC

Towards building a strong and meaningful strategy for sustainability, it is fundamental that we identify and assess aspects
of our business that are relevant to economic, environmental and social sustainability.

To carry out this assessment, the Sustainability Working Committee, along with the key departments within the Company
deliberated on the aspects of sustainability within the main categories of economy, product, governance, people and
planet as listed in the GRI G4 Guidelines. Accordingly, 20 material sustainability matters were identiﬁed and ranked to be
of medium, high or critical importance to the Company’s business operations as well as its stakeholders. Based on the
ranking, we derived the materiality matrix as shown below.

            good conduct, skill development and community engagement


Our diverse and talented workforce propels Hai-O to be a
successful business. By motivating them, engaging them
and understanding their concerns, we build loyalty.
Employee feedback is important to us and we conduct
surveys once every 3 years on aspects of our business
including pay, training, job security and quality of
leadership. The next survey is scheduled for 2019.

Furthermore, we encourage them to volunteer and support
communities that are less fortunate through our
community engagement programmes. By doing so, Hai-O’s
community outreach programmes have a positive impact
on both the employees and society at large.

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVENESS

We strongly believe that the creation of long-term value is
intrinsically linked to the development of human capital, a
strategic asset that Hai-O is committed to respect, protect
and nurture. By offering our employees a workplace that is
safe and conducive, where they can express their
capabilities and talent to the fullest, we sustain an effective
and dynamic team.

We recruit candidates that have the necessary
qualiﬁcations, experience, aptitude and are best suited for
the job, regardless of gender. This holds true even for the
selection of candidates for career advancement within the
organisation.

As shown below, female employees make up 61 per cent of
our workforce and male employees 39 per cent. It is worth
noting that across all 3 employment categories -
Management, Executive and Non-Executive - the number
of women exceed that of men.

CUSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETY

Wholesale - All pharmaceutical products including health supplements and traditional preparations must be registered
with the Drug Control Authority (“DCA”) of Malaysia before being marketed in Malaysia. Products registered with the DCA
have two main features, the registration number (starting with ‘MAL’) and genuine hologram security label, both of which
are available on the packaging. For instance, all our MAL products, including Chinese medicated liquor/tonic, traditional
Chinese medicine and external application products are duly observed with Meditag hologram labels on their packaging
which is a requirement. This allows our customers to verify the authenticity of the product and to buy from the registered
holder.

The National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau4 (“NPCB”) ensures the quality, safety and efﬁcacy of products for the local
market through a registration and licensing scheme. Drug interactions, side effects, shelf life, storage condition, signs
and symptoms of overdose are some of the product criteria that NPCB looks into before registering the product.

In order to maintain a valid registration as product registration holders, we fully comply with NPCB’s strict rules. Any
amendment to our MAL product labels or packaging requires submission to NPCB through QUEST-35 and is subject to
approval.
                                                                                                                                                57
4
    Pharmaceuticals, traditional and health supplements, cosmetics and veterinary products are regulated by NPCB.
5
    The Quest3 system is a new enhanced, integrated and computerised system used by the NPCB. It enables the Product License Holder,
    Manufacturer, Importer and other related users to conduct a secured online transaction for the purpose of product registration, renewal
    of registration, change of manufacturing site and for application for variation of product particulars such as labelling, packaging sizes
    and claims.
     SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT (CONT’D)
     PRODUCT (CONT’D)

     MLM - Within the MLM segment of our operations, all related products are assessed for their health and safety impacts
     and the assessments are done by professional testing bodies recognised by government agencies. The breakdown by
     product categories are:

                              Cosmetic and Personal Care products with 2 to 3-year shelf life
                                           Food products with 1 to 3-year shelf life
                                         Wellness products with 2 to 5-year shelf life

     Retail - Herby Natural Nutriments Meal, Zan Black Secret Mixed Cereal Powder, Zan Almond Walnut Cereal Powder, GLOU
     Glamo 10000 Collagen Drink and Herby Seaweed Drink undergo product inspection and come with a self-assessment
     report. Framing residue, moisture content, mold fungus, bacteria, PH, colour and lustre, and flavour are some of the product
     inspection criteria for which these products are assessed.


     PRODUCT LABELLING

     “Informed choice, much as in the case of nutrition labelling, is hoped to empower people to consume more sustainably”
     (European Commission, 2008). We believe that product labelling plays an important role in increasing transparency along
     the food chain and informing the consumer of the safe use of our products.

     Hai-O Cordyceps capsules and Min Kaffe are examples of products from Hai-O’s retail as well as MLM segment that
     provides product information to ensure customer awareness relating to product safety and quality.




     In fact, the product information on the packaging of products for MLM such as Min Kaffe is made available in 3 languages:
     English, Chinese and Bahasa Malaysia for the convenience of the customers.

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

Satisﬁed customers make a signiﬁcant impact on the Company’s bottom line. We distribute customer satisfaction surveys
on a yearly basis to garner their feedback on our products and services and to identify which aspect of the business needs
improvement.

Customer satisfaction surveys are carried out regularly at training programmes, during overseas incentive trips and at all
mega events organised by Hai-O. Besides which, we distribute an annual survey questionnaire which covers key aspects
of Hai-O’s MLM operations, including:
•   Product and distribution
•   Activity and events
•   Customer service and communication

Every MLM branch and stockist is given a ‘Distributor Memorandum’ for customers to ﬁll up should they have any
complaints or suggestions. All complaints including those relating to the product are received by customer service and
forwarded to the Product Development and Promotions department for further action through the ‘Monitoring and
Measurement of Product and Non-Conformity Control Procedure’. Through this channel, the total number of product
complaints received between May 2017 and April 2018 was 57 and all were resolved.

We continuously seek to establish sustainable and transparent lines of communication between the Company and our
customers as their feedback allows us to anticipate their needs and stay one step ahead. During the reporting period, we
received 4 complaints from Hai-O’s wholesale operation. All the cases were resolved.

     CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT

     Other ways in which we engage with our customers is through activities such as health talks and product sampling. The
     latter is essentially to allow our target customer to understand and explore the beneﬁts of our products.




     The retail segment of our operations provides a membership and loyalty programme to increase our customer’s value,
     organises health talks to enhance public and health knowledge on Traditional Chinese Medicine and provides priority
     purchase of selected products to members for a limited time period.

     In MLM, the distributors and customers are made aware of their rights as consumers through:
     •   Email: info@hai-omarketing.com.my
     •   Toll-free 1-800-88-2700 – Speciﬁc for product enquiry and is stated in the website and also product billboard
     •   WhatsApp – Another privilege enjoyed by CDM is access to an exclusive WhatsApp number




                                                                             1-800-88-2700

     The Company website, internal bulletins and Facebook messenger are other channels our customers can use to get in
     touch with us. In addition to online platforms, we interact with our customers through various types of training, courses
     and brieﬁngs so as to empower our distributors to be more competent and keep them on the cutting edge of industry
     developments.

            To strengthen our efforts towards protecting the environment
                     when carrying out our business operations.

We are keen to mitigate any negative impact on the environment brought on by our operations. Our steps in this direction
include improving energy efﬁciency, reducing waste that enters the landﬁll and promoting the use of eco-friendly products.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY

In order to reduce the use of incandescent bulbs which are inefﬁcient and contain hazardous mercury, we have begun
installing LED lights in stages at our ofﬁce and manufacturing premises. The latter is free from harmful chemicals,
recyclable and energy saving. As of 30 April 2018, the total percentage of LED lights installed at our main buildings, namely,
Wisma Hai-O, Wawasan Hai-O and Lot 1388, all of which are located in Jalan Kapar, Klang and Sun Kompleks in Kuala
Lumpur respectively was totalling to approximately 30 per cent.

As at FY2018, 7 out of Hai-O’s 49 retail outlets were installed with LED lights with an average yearly savings (RM) of 26
per cent per outlet. We plan to install LED lights in the other outlets in stages and to calculate the energy savings to assess
the environmental impact of switching to LED.

RECYCLING

At Wisma Hai-O, Wawasan Hai-O and Lot 1388, we practice 3R, i.e. Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. We segregate the waste
into plastic, paper and batteries, which are then collected by the respective scrap collectors. During the repair and
renovation of our buildings, we salvage the metal scrap which is also collected for reuse.



                                                         FY2018
                             Hai-O’s Waste Diverted from the Landﬁll




                     PLASTIC                  PAPER                  METAL                 BATTERY
                        693 kg                3,334 kg                2,299 kg               11 units


As per the advice of the Department of Environment (“DOE”), we disposed of the broken medicated glass bottles in a
manner that is less detrimental to the environment. Such glass waste collected from our warehouse and that which is
returned by customers are disposed at an engineered landﬁll that is in compliance with the highest requirement of the
DOE. During the reporting period, we disposed of 230 kg of glass waste in this way.

Yet another practice we observe in order to reduce wastage is to salvage broken wooden pallets and reuse carton boxes.
We are able to repair 3 to 4 broken pallets to make 2 units of wooden pallets for reuse. The carton boxes that we used to
pack all the assorted products ordered by customers before sealing and delivering to the customers, are also reused for
a couple of cycles as long as it is in good condition.

                                                                                                                                  61

     OTHER GREEN INITIATIVES

     Packaging - Within wholesale and retail, we have reduced the use of Polystyrene in packaging. Polystyrene or more
     commonly known as Styrofoam can be extremely useful and versatile, however, it is also known for its harmful effect on
     the environment.

     We have taken a cautious effort to reduce the use of Styrofoam in product packaging. As a result, the following products
     no longer have Styrofoam in their packaging:

                                 Hai-O Essence of Chicken with American Ginseng and Cordyceps
                               Hai-O Essence of Chicken with Ginkgo Biloba and American Ginseng
     Eco-friendly Products – The impact of chemical cleaning products on users who have long-term exposures at higher
     concentrations, can be severe. We acknowledge our ability to improve the well-being of our customers by increasing their
     accessibility to household products that are less harmful to the environment as well as to the health of the user. For
     instance, two of our household products - BioCleanz Multi-Purpose Cleaner and BioCleanz Multi-Purpose Spray - is made
     from Sea Ion6 extract. It is toxin-free, free of preservatives, contains non-toxic foaming agents, has no harmful
     petrochemicals to human health and environment, and made of natural perfumes, recyclable biodegradable and eco-
     friendly ingredients.

                                                                                         BioCleanz Multi-Purpose Spray




     Going Paperless – Towards conserving the use of paper and consequently, its wastage, we have taken efforts to encourage
     e-statements, e-registration and e-sales kit for our distributors. Since 1 January 2016, we have been using e-statements
     and besides its environmental beneﬁts, we have also noticed a reduction in late, missed and non-delivery hassles.

     1 October 2017 saw the introduction of member e-registration. E-registered distributors are now given an e-sales kit
     instead of hard copy sales kits which has led to savings in terms of resources used, printing cost, staff overheads and
     postage cost.




     CONCLUSION
     We recognise the importance of monitoring our year-on-year performance in order to identify gaps and set targets to
     further solidify our commitment to sustainability. Moving forward, we intend to progressively learn from and improve upon
