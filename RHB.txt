SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE
The Board of Directors plays an integral role in determining RHB Banking Group’s strategic direction and regards sustainability as a key component of
the Group’s business and operations. Monthly reviews are conducted on business performance, risk management, compliance, talent management and
other matters that are significant to the Group’s sustainable performance.

We have recently incorporated Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) integration in the Board Charter as one of the Board’s principal responsibilities
to promote sustainability through appropriate ESG considerations in the Company’s business strategies. The Group Managing Director and Senior
Management directly oversee the Group’s sustainability practices, decision making and performance.

The Group Management Committee meets on a monthly basis to discuss key agendas that are imperative to the Group’s sustainability objective.

Moving forward, we are working towards establishing a more structured and comprehensive Sustainability Framework as well as strategy and governance
structure which will guide the Group in internalising sustainability practices in its day-to-day operations.

KEY SUSTAINABILITY-RELATED RISKS & MITIGATION MEASURES
The Group has adopted the principles of sustainability and embedded them into its enterprise risk management framework. Performance management
systems, corporate policies and commitment to continuous improvement underpin our sustainability goals. Through our sustainability journey, we defined
our direction to manage our impacts and opportunities with increasing efficiency.

The Board has embedded measures to ensure responsible business conduct and the identification and assessment of risks associated with economic,
environmental and social matters. These risks are managed in conjunction with all other business risks, both financial and non-financial, and are reviewed
annually by the Board Risk Committee and the Board of Directors.

The Group’s risk management process identifies, measures, monitors and controls risk so that exposure is adequately managed and the expected returns
sufficiently outweigh the risks.

A continuous review of business activities and processes identify significant risk areas. Control procedures are implemented to operate within established
corporate policies and limits.

Fraud Risk Management
The Group has zero tolerance of internal fraud and all employees must take responsibility for maintaining high standards of ethics and integrity. In addition,
sensitising and raising awareness among employees on ethics and the prevention of fraud is instrumental in reducing instances of fraud.


Objectives of Our Comprehensive Fraud Risk Management
A comprehensive fraud risk management policy has been established with a primary objective of setting the tone and promoting a consistent organisational
behaviour on managing fraud risk in ensuring a secure, ‘least vulnerable to fraud’ environment in the Bank. The policy is supported by procedures across
operations and policies covering information security, outsourcing of financial services and whistle-blowing. Fraud management systems are deployed for
fraud detection and prevention in business and operational functions providing lending and e-banking services.

RHB Banking Group is committed to conducting its business in an ethical, honest and transparent manner. Bribery and corruption are damaging and will
have a detrimental impact on the Group’s business and operations. As such, the Group continues to strengthen its level of governance and continuously
inculcate ethical business practices among its Directors, Senior Management, employees, customers, service providers and other business partners. The
Group ensures compliance with all relevant laws, rules and regulations, inclusive of anti-corruption laws and anti-competition laws. This is part of the
Group’s long-term roadmap to ensure its business conduct is free from acts of corruption and internal fraud while acting in the best interests of the
Company, its shareholders and other stakeholders. The Group also carries out periodic monitoring of its anti-corruption and anti-fraud programmes to
ensure the existing programmes are relevant, effective and efficient in combatting such illegal activities. The Group opposes acts of bribery and corruption
as such acts destroy shareholder value, undermine investors’ confidence and are the antithesis of sustainable growth.

ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS

Stakeholder relationships are of the utmost importance as they help build networks that develop credible and united voices in areas that are important
to RHB. Evolving stakeholder preferences and requirements have shaped our vision and strategy. We have developed various formal and informal
engagement mechanisms that provide active communication pathways and channels. Stakeholders are provided with an effective forum to express their
expectations and concerns.

Communication channels are customised to suit each individual stakeholder group based on considerations such as individual stakeholder profiling and
ease of engagement. They are also supplemented with a host of initiatives to proactively assess feedback at multiple levels within the Bank. This analysis
helps deliver actionable insights and differentiated understanding. A more streamlined and concentrated strategy results in products and a process
framework that is geared towards meeting stakeholder expectations.

The stakeholder engagement map presented below provides an overview of our continual proactive engagement efforts with key stakeholder groups.

HOW MATERIALITY IS REFLECTED IN OUR 2017 REPORTING
The categories and issues ranked as most material directly shape the content of our Sustainability Report 2017. This is in line with our continued move
towards a more integrated reporting approach.

Understanding and prioritising key impacts, risks and opportunities is an ongoing process in which we review and analyse our external and internal
business context. Our materiality assessment is adjusted accordingly.

We will continue to engage with our shareholders, customers, employees, business partners and other stakeholders. Stakeholders’ insight is invaluable in
shaping our sustainability practices.

INDIRECT ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION
We played an important role in the overall economic activities of the country by facilitating business growth and providing the different segments of the
communities with access to a formal banking system. Our RHB Money Ma$ter Programme, a financial literacy programme, underlines how our RHB
Foundation helps the future generation to understand basic financial management and the importance of saving for the future.


RESPONSIBLE FINANCING PRACTICES
RHB promotes financial prudence and reinforces lending practices that supports the growth of the economy in a sustainable manner. To that end, RHB
adheres strictly to the regulations policies and guidelines set out by Bank Negara Malaysia.

Amongst, the guidelines are:

1.       Applicable to the following financing products:
         •    Home financing products;
         •    Personal financing products, including overdraft facilities;
         •    Vehicle financing products;
         •    Credit and charge card products; and
         •    Financing products for the purchase of securities except for
              share margin financing that is governed by Bursa Malaysia rules.

2.       The Financial Service Provider (FSP) shall conduct suitability and affordability assessments for each new and additional financing facility.

3.       The FSP must take reasonable steps to ensure that customers are offered products that are only appropriate to their financial circumstances and
         have the ability to repay by observing a prudent debt service ratio.

4.       Where the customer is self-employed, the FSP should evaluate the stability of the primary sources of income by requiring the customer’s evidence
         of income of at least 6 months.

5.       The FSP must verify the customer’s income against reliable sources which are independent of the customer and does not rely solely on the customer’s
         self-certification of income.

6.       Under guidance notes, for high net-worth customers (i.e. with total net personal assets exceeding RM1 million), flexibility is provided for the FSP to
         consider the customers’ deposits, assets and/or investments in assessing the customer’s ability to repay the financing.

7.       Sales and marketing staff/representatives are required to provide a product disclosure sheet to facilitate comparison and decision-making by
         consumers.

8.       Early termination fee imposed on the customer for repaying/paying the financing in part or in full during the lock-in period shall reflect a reasonable
         estimate of the costs to be incurred by the FSP as a direct result of early termination.



             Towards Nation Building
     •       RHB provides financing assistance to home buyers in the priority sector such as first-time buyers purchasing properties for less than RM250,000
             in Peninsular Malaysia and RM300,0000 in Sabah and Sarawak. As at 31 December 2017, RHB exceeded its target of 400 by providing financing
             assistance to 786 eligible individuals and families.
     •       RHB collaborated with other financial institutions and related organisations to develop a unique product offering higher financing amounts to
             eligible PRIMA homebuyers. The scheme offers lower installments during the initial years of the financing tenure.
