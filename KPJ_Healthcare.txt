The evolving healthcare landscape presents a multitude of challenges for healthcare service providers such as KPJ. It is incumbent upon
us to adapt, innovate and refine our business model, healthcare services and clinical processes to mitigate the negative impact of these
challenges. These include the need to improve the patient experience in our quest to provide patient-centric medical services, as we
create value through medical technology innovations which cascade through our network of hospitals.

We also need to take on board external macroeconomic considerations, such as responding to healthcare policies and complex
regulations, within a world with changing disease patterns. Ultimately, we need to provide affordable and accessible healthcare for the
communities we provide our services to.

KPJ navigates this complex healthcare landscape through sustained engagement with our stakeholders, as we seek to understand various
groups’ needs, while sharing our perspectives with them.

                                           quarter, along with SQM External Survey audits on these surveys to ensure they are conducted according to
                                           best practices and provide an accurate reflection of our quality of services. The Service Environment Audits
                                           are also conducted to ensure that our hospitals’ facilities meet the highest healthcare industry service level
                                           standards as performance indicators for our network of hospitals. In 2017, our customer satisfaction survey
                                           recorded a summary result performance of an average of 87% for KPJ Group of hospitals.

                                                       We have used PCMS to create an extremely important and useful knowledge base for our

                                                       Through PCMS, we are able to monitor the trend of complaints, along with the performance of

                                                  An inevitable reality of the healthcare sector is that patients will have to contend with waiting
                                                  time before they are able to see the clinicians or specialists they require, or access follow-up

                                                  waiting times as short as possible, and for our patients and their families not to end up wasting
                                                  their precious time in pursuing the quality healthcare service they seek.

                                                  To keep waiting times a comfortable proposition for our customers, each KPJ hospital comes
                                                  with facilities in the reception, lobby and other waiting areas providing for a pleasant space and

                                                  Our hospitals meticulously manage the flow of patients, with each staff given a specific role
                                                  within the patient journey, beginning from the patient’s arrival, till they seek treatment. This

     Secured Employment
     Since the inception of KPJUC, 75% of our graduates have secured employment in our hospitals and other subsidiaries. Our graduates are
     also sought after by our local and international competitors. As we continue with the expansion and upgrading of our network of hospitals in
     line with our growth strategy, our need for suitably qualified healthcare professionals will grow in tandem. Through KPJUC, we are ensuring
     continuous and sustainable access to a ready talent pool of trained and qualified graduates with established knowledge of KPJ operations
     and standards.

Ensuring access to comprehensive, quality healthcare services is of paramount importance in the promotion and maintenance of health,
and the prevention and management of disease. In line with this, Malaysia has identified achieving universal access to healthcare as one
of the focus areas of the 11th Malaysia Plan 2016 – 2020. As part of the healthcare ecosystem in Malaysia, private healthcare services
providers play an important role in achieving this goal through the expansion of capacities and increasing accessibility to healthcare.
Part of KPJ’s approach towards increasing access to quality healthcare lies in our strategic plans to expand our healthcare network in
Malaysia. However, we also work towards increasing healthcare access in other areas as laid out below.

KPJ has in place comprehensive processes with regards to the management of waste generated
from our hospital activities. While the majority of waste produced is general waste, some clinical
waste is hazardous and requires stringent protocols in its disposal. We are mindful that the
improper disposal of waste at a healthcare facility could cause a health hazard or disease outbreak.          HAZARDOUS WASTE
In protecting our patients, employees, visitors and the community at large, we ensure that all our
                                                                                                              (Clinical waste)(kg)
waste is disposed of in a responsible manner.
                                                                                                              FY2017        FY2016            FY2015

In 2017, the amount of hazardous waste produced from our hospitals increased from 1,170,870 kg                1,190,888     1,170,870         976,136
in 2016 to 1,190,888 kg in 2017 due to an increase in patients’ activities. However, our hazardous
waste generated per patient remained at 0.5 kg.


AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT
Hospitals are complex environments and the management of indoor air quality (IAQ) requires
special attention to ensure healthy IAQ levels. A myriad of involved factors need to be considered
in maintaining healthful IAQ such as temperature, humidity, as well as chemical and biological
                                                                                                              N O . O F P AT I E N T S S E R V E D
contaminants that can affect a person’s health and well-being.
                                                                                                              FY2017        FY2016            FY2015

Our patients’ conditions result in them possessing air contaminants in their systems which                    2,329,530     2.289,990         2,294,318

can lead to potential infections of the people who surround them, allergic reactions, viruses,
respiratory problems and other diseases and health issues. Airborne chemical and microbiological
contaminants are another area of concern.

Bearing all this in mind, KPJ has implemented stringent control and mitigation measures crucial to
ensure high IAQ levels through our various IAQ programmes such as:
                                                                                                              T O TA L W A S T E
• Restricting air movement in and between various departments                                                 (kg/patient)
• Ensuring property humidity and temperature levels for various hospital areas
• Complying with specific requirements for ventilation and filtration to dilute and remove                    FY2017        FY2016            FY2015

• Regular upkeep of the Air Handling Units (AHU) by replacing filters in a timely manner
• Decontamination of ventilation ducts and making sure that all related mechanical aspects are
  maintained in accordance with the hospital’s requirement and standards

R A D I AT I O N M A N A G E M E N T
A number of medical equipment used within a hospital’s premises emit radiation, such as Diagnostic
Imaging, Radiotherapy and Oncology Services. These pose to people within its vicinity the risk
of exposure to harmful levels of radiation which could result in radiation burn, acute radiation
syndrome and cancer.
KPJ is extremely mindful of the dangers associated with radiation exposure and has in place a set
of measures designed to comply with safety regulations such as:
• Compliance with the Atomic Energy Licensing Act 1984 (Act 304)
• Annual application for a Class C licence under the Radiation Protection (Licensing) Regulations
  1986 from MOH to operate radiation emitting equipment
• A Quality Assurance Programme (QAP), guided by the Atomic Energy Licensing (Basic Safety
  Radiation Protection) Regulations 2010, to ensure our performance and safety standards meet
  specific requirements to provide a safe environment for our patients and staff

The nature of a hospital’s activities inevitably result in high electricity consumption patterns, as it serves the needs of patients, staff
and visitors, within a facility which is open 24/7. In a typical hospital, electricity is used within sophisticated heating, ventilation and air
conditioning (HVAC) systems to control temperatures and air flow. As well as that, many energy intensive activities occur in attending to
laundry, medical and lab equipment use, sterilisation, computer and server use, food service and refrigeration.

At KPJ, we have implemented measures to increase our energy efficiency, in order to improve our bottom line and free up funds to invest
in new technologies and improve patient care. We regularly run campaigns to increase staff awareness on energy efficiency and electricity
saving initiatives. Our e-idea platform encourages our employees to contribute their suggestions on energy conservation measures.

During the year, we initiated our pilot project focussing on energy saving systems at KPJ HQ . The upgrading of the chiller system at
KPJHQ was conducted with a total cost of RM3 million.

In 2017, our electricity consumption increased to 119,661,200 kWh from 104,610,410 kWh in 2016 due to an increase in the number of new
hospital service areas and the expansion of our hospital network. However, our average electricity consumption per sq ft decreased by
5% or 1.25kWh from 26.37 kWh to 25.12 kWh. Moving into 2018, our target is to limit our electricity consumption to not more than 26.37
kWh per sq ft.

All hospitals are directed to adopt the sustainability strategies and initiatives on electricity management and reported and discussed at
the hospitals’ Board Meetings. The initiatives are scheduled and to be carried out systematically until 2019.

 system                 electricity consumption decreased by 14% or 76,506 kWh between November 2017 and December 2017.

                        A few hospitals have planned to upgrade their chillers in 2018/2019.

 Replacement of         Most of the hospitals have started replacing the lighting system to LEDs since 2016. The high usage areas are the
 light bulbs with       lobby and corridor which require 24 hours lighting. This is also includes entrances and emergency exit signs.

 Installation of        Hospitals identified areas and allocated shutdown schedule within every floor or area. The shutdown is controlled
 timers                 by timers. For example, the electricity at Administration Services will be off from 6.00 pm till 8.00 am and the air
                        conditioning system will be shutdown from 8.00 pm till 8.00 am.

                                                  It has been estimated that a baby is found abandoned in Malaysia once every four days.* Academics
                                                  and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) also surmise that the estimated rate of child
                                                  abandonment is increasing, along with the infanticide rate as many of these unwanted babies are left
                                                  in dangerous and unhealthy places.

                                                  In line with Governmental policy to provide an avenue for mothers or parents of unwanted babies to

                                                  date, we now have baby hatches in nine KPJ hospitals throughout Malaysia.

                                                  The baby hatches are a collaborative endeavour with the Social Welfare Department (JKM) and
                                                  OrphanCare, a child protection NGO. Since its launch in 2010, we have received 28 babies through
                                                  our baby hatches. Babies found in the baby hatch are placed for adoption through a regulated
                                                  process overseen by OrphanCare and JKM in Peninsular Malaysia, whereas in East Malaysia, this
                                                  process is overseen by JKM only.

                                                  We also provide mothers, guardians or other family members who find it difficult to provide for the
                                                  baby and are considering abandoning them with help through discussion, sharing of information
                                                  and counselling from nurses or social care staff. This is conducted under a strict privacy protocols to
                                                  alleviate the social stigma attached to baby abandonment for adoptions.

In 2017, our employees received an average of 40 hours of
training, exceeding the mandatory 30 hours of training per
year. Our total Human Resource Development Fund (HRDF)
utilisation was 82% for 2017, compared to 88% the previous year.
Although no new hospitals subscribed to the scheme, there were
expansions in our existing hospital network through increases
in the number of beds and introduction of new services which
resulted in new staff hires. This resulted in an overall increase in
subscription.
