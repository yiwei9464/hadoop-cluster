SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT (CONTINUED)

  2)		 Procurement
			
			 The Group supports local products and services by procuring its raw materials from established business entities locally to
			 support local industries. The production processes are conducted under controlled environment to uphold the regulatory
			 hygiene practices. All our raw materials and finished products adhere to the “Halal” standard and requirement in accordance
			 to the strict guidelines from JAKIM.


B)   Environment Aspect

     The Group takes environmental issues seriously as it realises the impact which could have negative impact to the future
     generations. The company works closely with environmental regulators to ensure that it is in compliance with all standards at all
     times to reduce the impact to the environment. It manages its environmental initiatives diligently in ensuring low environmental
     footprint at all stages of its production lines through recycling process and managing its waste products in an effective and
     efficient manner.

     1)		 Energy

			 At the same time, the Group is striving towards a more efficient sustainable management strategy in the use of its energy
			 resources to reduce its carbon footprint.

			      The Group has introduced the “Lights Off” campaign where the lightings are kept to a minimum during non-working hours; and
			      installation of motion detector lighting system within certain office areas are just some of the initiatives implemented. Air-
			      conditioners temperature in the office areas are preset to no lower than 25°C degrees is also another effort put in place to
			      reduce energy usage.

     2)		 Waste Management

			 Stringent policy on waste management and recycling process were introduced which have resulted in a significant reduction
			 of waste generated from the production areas.

     3)		 Noise and Air Pollution

			 The Group has engaged consultants to review the noise and air pollution generated from the production floor in ensuring that
			 these pollution is within the allowable range, and in fact kept below the minimum statutory requirement levels.


C) Social Aspect

     1)		 Product Quality and Food Safety System

			      Based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) data, an estimated 1 in 10 people in the world fall ill after consuming
			      contaminated food. A substantial number of people die every year due to unsafe food intake. This has created a vicious
			      cycle of emergence of diseases and malnutrition scenario which in turn affect the quality of lifestyle. The impact of
			      contamination affects the whole class of society from infants, young children, to the elderly and the sick.

			      All these could have been averted if responsible food safety initiatives are introduced. Being a food-based producer, The
			      Group takes seriously this issue and has put in much efforts to the implementation of strict hygienic conditions which are
			      in compliant with the relevant regulatory bodies such as the Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”) and Hazard Analysis and
			      Critical Control Points (“HACCP”). The Group is proud to have employed high standard of product quality and food safety
			      systems in the manufacture of its products.These processes are constantly adhered to with the recent certification of
			      ISO 22000 in October 2018, and in continual effort to ensure the processes constantly adhered to the regulation and food
			      safety requirements, quality controls are put in place from point of receiving the purchased materials, to processing in
			      production lines, and releasing of finished goods from warehouse. In-house facilities provided storage of materials with
			      designed allocation for ‘sensitive’ and ‘non-sensitive’ ingredients, while packaging materials stored according to categories
			      with inspection conducted prior to release for production use. As assurance step to food safety, production areas are
			      designed with segregation between processing sections, and a ‘clean room’ is constructed with controlled airflow with
			      monitored environment climate to minimize thus eliminate risk of cross-contamination. All finished goods are then packed
			      and properly placed at allocated storing area in manufacturing plants before transferred to finished goods warehouse before
			      released for consignment.

			      Machineries and monitoring devices are scheduled for routine service and calibration to ensure well-operating and production
			      of finished goods is controlled within specification, with process controls monitored to avoid any risk of product faulty and
			      cross contamination in-line. The assurance of Good Hygiene Practice (“GHP”) among workers is supervised with facility
			      equipped with hand-washing stations, while compliance of personal protective attire is monitored during operation.




                                                                                                                                          17
