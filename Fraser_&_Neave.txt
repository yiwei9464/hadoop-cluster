         SUSTAINABILITY VISION & FRAMEWORK

     As the global context becomes increasingly defined by volatility and unpredictability, prioritising sustainability is no longer an option for
     businesses but the only viable path. F&N recognises the range of emerging risks and challenges that we must respond to.

     To continue delivering value to our stakeholders, we must root our activities in resilience and embrace the inter-connections we share with our
     communities and environment. It is thus our vision to create a financially, environmentally, and socially sustainable future for our
     business by:

     ‚Ä¢    Delivering value through innovation, human capital development and social collaboration; and

     ‚Ä¢    Managing our impacts and conduct business in a responsible manner.

     Our overall sustainability framework comprises six core areas, under the theme are:

                                           Delivering Value                                Managing our Impacts

     OUR MATERIAL ISSUES

     We undertook our first materiality assessment in January 2017 to identify, prioritise, validate and review relevant sustainability issues. Our Sustainability
     Development Committee revisited the 15 material issues identified last year and confirmed that these topics remain important. The major change this
     year is the increased importance of Talent Management to the business. The right talent acquisition and capability building of our people are critical
     now more than ever, to accelerate F&NHB‚Äôs growth and innovation agenda.

The material issues have been categorised into the six Core Areas of our Sustainability framework, in two main themes, which will provide sharper
focus on how we want to create value for each material issue. As part of the review process and setting targets for the next financial year, we will
re-evaluate our material issues, achievements and goals. Our performance in FY2018 will serve as a benchmark to guide us in strategising and setting
our sustainable development goals in the coming years.

     SUMMARY OF OUR GROUP TARGETS & PROGRESS
     As part of our commitment to sustainability, we have established 9 key performance targets in 2017 for the entire F&N Group including Singapore,
     Malaysia and Thailand, based on the high priority material issues identified. These medium-term performance targets are set to be achieved by 2020.

     Recognising the importance placed on climate change, a new target to reduce our greenhouse gas intensity has been added this year, as part of our
     commitment in the global call-to-action on Energy & Climate Change management.

     Empowering Youth with Basic Computer Skills
     While information technology (IT) skills are deemed necessity today,
     not everyone can afford computer literacy programmes. F&N sees this
     as a gap in community development, and has thus initiated a partnership
     with ICDL, the world‚Äôs leading computer skills certification, to provide
     these skills to Malaysia‚Äôs underprivileged youth. To date, 390 students of
     Monfort Town have gained the certification through the International
     Computer Driving Licence (ICDL) Programme.

Leadership Programme for Underprivileged Youth
F&NHB has been partnering with Leaderonomics, a social enterprise
dedicated to transforming communities through leadership development.
Organised since 2015, the programme aims to nurture discipline,
develop interpersonal skills, boost self-confidence and encourage
teamwork among young residents of Rumah Ilham. This year, 42
children, aged between nine and 17 years old participated in a two-day,
one-night leadership camp. Acting as trainers, these children applied
their knowledge and skills acquired from the camp into organising
leadership development programme for children from KAFA Integrasi
Hidayatul Islamiah Kampung Baru Hicom. F&NHB has so far invested
RM225,000 in the programme benefitting over 170 children who are
now more confident and better prepared to contribute in a meaningful
way to society.

Library for Children Project
The devasting flood that ravaged Thailand in 2012 caused catastrophic
damage to the school library of much underfunded Wat Lin Thong
school in Ang Thong province. The room, books collection and equipment
were all damaged.

Through ‚ÄúLibrary for Children‚Äù project, our team in Thailand was in a
mission to reinvigorate the flood- damaged library. Funds from the
Company, along with donation from our employees, allowed the school
to refurbish the library, install book shelves and air-conditioners, and
also to purchase new sets of educational books, including science and
mathematics. We also donated 4 computers, 1 printer and 1 scanner to

     ECO-EFFICIENCY
     In the previous part of this report we described many of the ways in which we deliver economic and social value. This part of the report sets out the
     main ways in which F&NHB ensure sustainable value creation by minimising environmental impact associated with our operations. As part of our
     materiality assessment, we have identified three main issues in relation to our eco-efficiency efforts:

     We implement environmentally sustainable business practices in alignment with F&NHB‚Äôs core values, and employees are guided by our Environmental
     Policy at all times.


                                                                     Our Environmental Policy


         All of our operations in Malaysia and Thailand are guided by the following principles, to:
         ‚Ä¢   Provide senior management support and resources to drive our environmental agenda.
         ‚Ä¢   Comply with applicable environmental legislation and regulation and other requirements that we subscribe to.
         ‚Ä¢   Continually enhance our environmental performance and standards.
         ‚Ä¢   Use natural resources wisely and adopt best practices in our daily operations.
         ‚Ä¢   Continuously improve our processes to reduce water & energy consumption and minimise waste.
         ‚Ä¢   Prevent air, water and other pollution, and dispose of waste safely and responsibly.
58
         Our employees, business partners and stakeholder groups are all aware of our Environmental Policy and have given their support for our goals.
         To ensure that our policies are valid and up to date, they are reviewed regularly.



     In the following pages we will explain our targets, management approach and performance for each of our eco-efficiency areas of focus: water
     stewardship; effluents & waste; and energy & climate change. We will show that eco-efficiency is not just about reducing the environmental impacts
     of our operations, it also often makes good business sense for F&NHB.

       Target: To reduce the water ratio at our plants by 5% from
       2017 by 2020.                                                               Many regions in both Thailand and Malaysia have faced floods in recent

       Progress in 2018: Water ratio in 2018 has reduced by 1%                     problems in the future. All life is dependent on accessible and safe water
       from 2017.                                                                  supplies, and F&NHB has a duty to manage our water use accordingly to
                                                                                   safeguard availability for local communities.

We take every opportunity and approach to reduce water consumption and meet our 2020 water intensity target and are carrying out various projects
and initiatives to achieve this.

 Plant                        through recovering water usage from the can rinser and twister phase.
                              Previously, water from the can rinser and can twister phase are drained
                              out after it has been used in this process. A water recovery system has
                              since been installed and implemented to reuse water from the can rinser
                              and twister phase so that it can be reused in the can warming phase,
                              hence reducing water consumption and costs significantly.

 Condensate Recovery          Steam loss during the production phase is an area where we can reduce             Water Reduction: 14,755 m3/year
 Project ‚Äì Shah Alam          water consumption, most notably in the pasteurisation phase through               Cost Savings: RM33,644.60/year
 Plant                        steam trap replacement and appropriate piping system. Steam header
                              automatic valves have also been installed at various points to reduce steam
                              loss. This initiative has contributed significantly to water consumption
                              reduction targets and cost savings.

 Rain Harvesting System       F&N will soon be implementing a rainwater harvesting system to extract            We have just started the project.

     Notes:
     1. The data for Malaysia excludes our two water plants in Matang and Bentong as they do not have Waste Water Treatment Plant and they are unable to
        measure the water discharged.
     2. The data for Thailand excludes our one dairy plant in Rojana as they do not have Waste Water Treatment Plant and they are unable to measure the water
        discharged.
       [1] COD is the measure of the amount of oxygen required to oxidise soluble and particulate organic matter in water. It provides an index to assess the effect
           discharged water would have on the receiving environment. Higher COD levels mean a greater amount of oxidisable organic matter which will reduce
           dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. Low DO levels are harmful to higher aquatic life forms.
       [2] BOD is the amount of DO bacteria will consume to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific
           time period. As with the COD, the higher the BOD, the less able the water body is to support healthy aquatic life.
       [3] TSS is the dry-weight of particles trapped by a filter. It is a water quality parameter used to assess the quality of wastewater after treatment in a
           wastewater treatment plant.

Our Approach
Malaysia‚Äôs government has targeted a 45% reduction in GHG intensity by 2030 from a 2005 baseline, and Thailand has a reduction target of 30% by
2036 from a 2010 baseline. As a key producer in both markets, F&NHB is committed to support the governments‚Äô targets and we have set an initial
goal to reduce our energy intensity by 5% between 2017 and 2020.

Our energy and climate change related activities can be broken down into four priority areas. The first three relate to minimising our own impacts,
and the final one relates to how we are adapting to climate change risks:

     Improving energy efficiency in our operations makes business sense just as much as it helps to reduce our environmental impacts. We have a range
     of initiatives including: technical solutions for our buildings and equipment (for example timers, LED lighting); process solutions to eradicate wasted
     energy (for example heat recovery from boilers); and behavioural solutions to reinforce a culture of good practice throughout our workforce (for
     example daily monitoring of energy consumption):

Renewable energy sourcing and generation
Energy efficiency can make a significant contribution, but we recognise that in order to decouple our activities from GHG emissions, we must transition
from hydrocarbon-based energy to renewable energy. We have begun to do this and are making moves to source more of our electricity from low-
carbon and renewable sources. Further to this, we are also exploring options to generate our own renewable energy at our sites.

PACKAGING

We strive to ensure our packaging protects the integrity of the contents and it is user and eco-friendly on top of fulfilling the visual and functional
aspects to our consumers. There is much scope for innovation in packaging, which we have been exploring over the years. This has helped us maintain
a healthy packaging ratio, namely volume of packaging material used as a measure of quantity of product.

There is increasing stakeholder awareness of the importance of environmentally-friendly packaging, especially in relation to plastics. The Group will
continue to focus on innovation to increase the recyclability of the primary and secondary packaging used in our products.

Our Approach
We have a two-pronged approach to reduce the environmental impacts of our packaging: first, by improving the environmental performance of our
packaging, and second, by regularly seeking and evaluating new innovations and technology in packaging materials and processes.

This year, we have launched a new Aseptic Cold-Filling Line at our plant in Shah Alam, which currently produces 100PLUS ACTIVE, F&N SEASONS and
OYOSHI products. This new line uses advanced technology that enables lesser usage of PET resin packaging material by 40 per cent. In addition, the
products have a longer shelf life, which leads to less waste.

Through our sustained efforts, we continue to leverage on innovation and technological advancement to reduce the weight of our packaging.
‚Ä¢   Our beverage plants in Malaysia have reduced the weight of PET bottles (500ml, 600ml and 1.5L) and water cap, and this has helped to save
    material usage by about 70 MT this year.
‚Ä¢   Our dairy plant in Malaysia has reduced tin material usage by about 166 MT this year.

Healthy Workforce
Our Health Risk Assessment Committee is staffed with trained personnel who can comprehensively review areas where employees may be exposed
to health risks. Here, we focus on ensuring an environment conducive to employee wellbeing and incentivise healthy habits. Our work environment is
enhanced with ergonomic facilities to prevent office-related injuries and includes shower facilities to help employees integrate physical activity into
their daily work life. Employees have free access to company-organised events such as badminton tournaments and zumba classes.

Air quality, brightness, temperature and noise levels are monitored in all of our facilities. In April 2018, we provided audiometric tests for all at-risk
workers, with follow-up doctor consultations where impairments were identified.

In 2018, our employees attended a total of 5,049 hours of safety training, 895 employees participated in at least one safety training activity. Training
topics included:

In both Malaysia and Thailand, we organised regular activities to engage our employees more frequently on safety topics. Some of these activities
included safety, health and environment awareness week, a SHE Drama activity, an internal ISO 45001 audit and training, and some guest lectures
from the Ministry of Health and the Department of Environmental. In Thailand, there is also a monthly newsletter sent to employees about health &

PRODUCT & SERVICE LABELLING
GRI 417-1, GRI 417-2

Our packaging and labelling are the primary method through which we communicate information to consumers
about our products‚Äô quality, nutrition, safety and disposal. It is therefore essential that our labelling is
comprehensive and clear, allowing our busy customers to make fully informed purchasing decisions.


Our Approach
Our labelling adheres to the Food Act in Malaysia and requirements of the Food and Drug Administration in
Thailand. But we go beyond mandatory requirements, and for all products we provide information on:
ingredients; sourcing; energy per serving size; recommended daily allowances (RDA) of the different nutritional
components; expiry dates; and nutrition tips,

All information disclosed on our labels is subject to a review process involving a range of internal experts
including our R&D and Scientific & Regulatory Affairs teams, plus dietician advice. Labels are then sent to
government authorities for verification and endorsement.


In order to make it as easy as possible for consumers to understand fundamental information (Calories and contribution to recommended daily Calorie
intake), we include ‚Äòfront of pack labelling‚Äô for an increasing range of our products in Malaysia. This includes our 100PLUS range and F&N NutriSoy.

We take care to ensure that our marketing and advertising activities do not make any ethical breaches. We adhere to the Malaysian Code of Advertising
Practice in Malaysia and the Consumer Protection Act of B.E. 2522 (1979) in Thailand. In Malaysia, we are a signatory to the ‚ÄòResponsible Advertising
to Children‚Äô initiative, and have pledged to severely restrict marketing to children under 12 years of age. For example, we will only advertise children‚Äôs
products that meet specific nutritional criteria based on accepted scientific evidence and national and international dietary guidelines.                    83


Our Performance Highlights
GRI 417-2
Throughout all of our product information, labelling and marketing communications efforts in FY2018 to the best of our knowledge, there was no
incident of non-compliance with regulations or voluntary codes resulting in a fine, penalty or warning.

GRI 417-1
