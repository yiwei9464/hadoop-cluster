WORK-LIFE BALANCE

To affirm the Bank’s commitment to providing
employees with a supportive workplace for work-
life effectiveness, Flexible Work Arrangement
(“FWA”) through Staggered Work Hours and
Reduced Work Hours were introduced.

Under the FitMuamalat Corporate Wellness
Programme, employees actively participate in
various sports and wellness activities organised
by the Sports & Recreation Club (“SRC”) in
collaboration with our Corporate Wellness Unit.

The FitMuamalat app was launched in 2018 to
support this initiative, enabling the tracking of
fitness and wellness activities.

This contributed to a high level of engagement                187 employees
across divisions through formal and informal                      (11%)
activities, strengthening team spirit within and
between divisions. We estimate around 90% of             have benefited from FWA
employee engagement through this initiative.            since its implementation in
                                                                March 2018.
