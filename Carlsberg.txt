SUSTAINABILITY 
STATEMENT 
PROGRESS TOWARDS 
ZERO 
As a responsible corporate citizen, we 
are mindful of our role in securing 
a sustainable future for us and the 
communities we interact with in an era 
when climate change, water scarcity 
and public health are ever-increasing 
global issues. 
This is why our sustainability 
programme, Together Towards ZERO, 
is as high a priority for all of us at 
Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia as the 
fnancial and strategic health of the 
business. 
Having run the programme for over a 
year in line with our global goals, we 
are convinced that the science-based 
and partnership-driven approach 
embodied in the targets set for 
Together Towards ZERO is effective 
in increasing effciency, reducing risks 
and building resilience all along our 
value chain in our efforts to build a 
sustainable business. 
Scope 
Our Sustainability Statement this 
year underscores our commitment to 
conduct our business in a sustainable 
manner across the value chain. It 
covers key sustainability initiatives in 
our Malaysia and Singapore operations 
from 1 January to 31 December 2018. 
However, our associate company, Lion 
Brewery (Ceylon) PLC, is not included 
in this report given that we do not have 
direct management control. 
Details of our 'Together Towards ZERO' 
programme, along with our strategy 
and performance in 2018, are laid out 
within our four sustainability ambitions 
- ZERO Carbon Footprint, ZERO Water 
Waste, ZERO Irresponsible Drinking 
and ZERO Accidents Culture, which 
have been set with clear and measurable 
targets for 2022 and 2030 respectively. 
This report updates you on our progress. 
40 
Together, the four ambitions focus 
particularly on the environmental and 
social pillars of our operations with our 
economic contributions forming the 
foundation of our sustainability efforts. 
Additional data is also disclosed under 
the heading 'Committing Towards a 
Responsible Business'. 
All of the information provided is 
extracted from the Enablon online 
sustainability reporting platform, 
adopted Groupwide and used in our 
global sustainability reporting. 
This Sustainability Statement is to be 
read in conjunction with the rest of 
Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Berhad's 
2018 Annual Report, which highlights 
other fnancial and non-fnancial 
aspects of our business. 
Governance 
Our sustainability performance 
is overseen by the Management 
team, led by Managing Director, and 
endorsed by the Board of Directors. 
A network of Together Towards ZERO 
area and policy owners have been 
assigned to implement the relevant 
key performance indicators (KPIs), so 
that the functions that have the biggest 
impact and ability to infuence are 
empowered to initiate change. 
We leverage on the Enablon online 
sustainability reporting system to 
track performance in all policy areas 
on a regular basis, including monthly, 
quarterly, half-yearly, and annual 
intervals.

Our Purpose has always been clear 
- Brewing for a Better Today and 
Tomorrow. This means the pursuit of 
perfection every day as we strive to 
brew better beers that stand at the 
heart of moments that bring people 
together. It also means we do not 
focus merely on short-term gains, but 
work towards a sustainable future for 
our business, stakeholders, and the 
communities we operate in. 
We also believe a healthy business 
ensures that proftability and 
sustainability co-exist in harmony, 
which is why we have embedded 
sustainability into our corporate 
strategy, SAIL'22, via the two enablers - 
'Create a Winning Culture' and 'Defend 
our License to Operate'. 
ZERO

Ultimately it sets us towards our vision 
of becoming a successful, professional 
and attractive brewer in the markets 
we operate in.

ZERO Water Waste, ZERO Irresponsible

ANNUAL REPORT 2018 
TOWARDS FULL 
SUSTAINABILITY 
Our sustainability programme was 
devised by Carlsberg Group with the 
support of leading global experts 
using a science-based approach. It 
is an ambitious programme that is 
aligned with the United Nations' 
(UN) Sustainable Development 
Goals and the Paris Agreement on 
Climate Change. 
The UN's Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) are ambitious goals for 
a more sustainable world and call on 
governments, civil society, businesses 
and the general public to act to end 
poverty, reduce inequality and reduce 
climate change by 2030. 
The SDGs are interconnected, share 
equal importance and within each 
goal occupy a number of targets and 
topics. 
Our Together Towards ZERO 
programme focuses on SDG goals 
and targets that are relevant to our 
business and where we can have the 
greatest infuence and impact. 
The four key areas — ZERO Carbon 
Footprint, ZERO Water Waste, 
ZERO Irresponsible Drinking and a 
ZERO Accidents Culture are aligned 
to SDGs 3, 6, 7, 8 and 13, which 
advocate good health and wellbeing, 
clean water and sanitation, 
affordable and clean energy, decent 
work and economic growth, and 
climate action. 
Our 'Reuse, Reduce, Recycle and 
Rethink' (4R) programme supports 
SDG 12, which aims, amongst 
others, at substantial reduction in 
waste generation by 2030 through 
prevention, reduction, recycling and 
reuse. 
Our sustainability approach mirrors 
SDG 17, which promotes partnerships 
for the goals, by increasing the 
involvement of relevant stakeholders 
in our T TZ programmes.
