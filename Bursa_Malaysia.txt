A total of 17 Material Matters were subsequently deliberated and approved by the CSC and BOD at the end of the assessment process. The boundary for
each Material Matter was considered either within our own operations (otherwise known as internal) or across the markets (otherwise known as external),
depending on the nature of each matter.


The list of Material Matters was presented in a matrix to demonstrate their relative priority to our organisation and stakeholders.

     We have also mapped out our Material Matters against the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as we seek to align our initiatives with the
     SDGs.

     Stakeholder Engagement
     Being a central point of the Malaysian capital market, we place significant emphasis on stakeholder engagement to ensure that what we
     do resonates well with our stakeholders. We interact with a large group of people or entities (that are directly or indirectly influenced by our
     business activities, or can significantly affect our decisions) to solicit feedback and views on a wide range of market and business issues on
     a day-to-day basis. In addition to these engagements, in 2018, we also engaged with those stakeholders pertaining to our Material Matters,
     the outcome of which was subsequently used to define the content of our Sustainability Report 2018 and inform the formulation of the
     Sustainability Roadmap 2019 - 2020.

            Case Study: Closing Market Gaps through Targeted Engagement
            In 2018 we continued to hold regular Securities Market Operations Committee (SMOC) meetings to identify operational, business
            and development matters relating to the securities industry as well as to ensure smooth, timely resolution of such matters and
            implementation of our initiatives.

            The SMOC is chaired by our CEO and represented by members from our management team, the Association of Stockbroking
            Companies Malaysia (ASCM), the Malaysian Investment Banking Association (MIBA) and foreign intermediaries to deliberate on and
            address pertinent issues/matters facing the industry.

            In addition to SMOC meetings, we have also formed Technical Working Groups (TWGs) as part of the stakeholder engagement in
            initiative execution. Through TWGs, ideas for impactful initiatives were gathered with the intention to be industry outcome-focused
            and output-driven.Year 2018 saw the formation of five TWGs, of which two TWGs have successfully met their objectives and have
            since concluded with the delivery of their intended outcomes. Details are as below:

            Concluded TWGs are:

From our assessment of the website traffic, we observed that most of the PLCs’ reports were viewed after the release of quarterly financial
results announcements. The research reports were therefore, deemed to be a viable source of reference by investors for Bursa MidS PLCs
given that these PLCs may have viable investment propositions based on fundamentals that were not well covered previously.

             Liquidity Risk Framework, aimed to assist the POs in                              practices for automated trading, as well as guidance in
             managing their capital resources more effectively and                             identifying irregular trading behaviours and red flags
             mitigating default risk, and to enhance the quality and                           associated with electronic trading. The issuance of the ICON-
             effectiveness of their existing stress-testing requirements                       ET is expected to ensure that POs have a greater sense of

             reduction of any ad-hoc directive or intervention against the
             intermediaries by Bursa Malaysia on liquidity issues covered
             under the stress-testing framework. Intermediaries are also
             expected to reduce the ad-hoc utilisation of their standby
             facilities as they are now able to plan the optimum utilisation
             of their financial resources.



     Our reviews during the year showed that our intermediaries exhibited a satisfactory level of compliance in both their back office and middle
     office functions to date. They have also instituted effective safeguard measures to protect investors’ interests and their assets which indicate
     that they have satisfactory standards of business conduct and self-regulation. During the year under review, no supervisory breach was noted
     among the intermediaries.

     Corporate Disclosure and Financial Health
     In our efforts to ensure the integrity and stability of our capital market for the long-term, we monitor and supervise PLCs’ disclosure
     obligations to ensure sufficient and relevant information is provided for investors to make informed investment decisions. Our supervisory
     activities and approaches in monitoring and supervising compliance with disclosure obligations include reviewing PLCs’ announcements,
     circulars and other documents as well as issuing media queries to PLCs to provide responses and clarifications in order to provide
     shareholders and investors with adequate and accurate information.

MARKET INTEG RITY & S TABI LI TY




In our continuous efforts to elevate the standard of disclosures in our market, we also undertake developmental initiatives to improve
disclosure practices and the compliance culture among PLCs. Such initiatives in 2018 included the following:




  PRE-EMPTIVE SUPERVISORY APPROACH

  Under this new supervisory approach, subsequent to the announcement of a complex corporate proposal, we will engage PLCs and/or
  advisers before the draft circular is submitted for our review. During the engagement, we will highlight areas which require greater focus to
  ensure that information in the circular is comprehensive for shareholders’ decision-making. The key objective of this approach is to ensure
  that circulars submitted to us are complete and contain all required information, thus facilitating our review. It also allows the completion of
  such proposals to be further expedited.




   EXPANSION OF GREEN LANE POLICY (GLP) IN DEALING WITH CIRCULARS AND APPLICATIONS BY FTSE BURSA MALAYSIA TOP 100
   (FBMT100) PLCs

   The GLP is a differentiated approach implemented towards recognising and incentivising PLCs with good CG and disclosure practices
   (Qualified PLCs). These Qualified PLCs are accorded with certain privileges such as exemption from having their circulars (excluding
   complex circulars) submitted to Bursa Malaysia first before issuance of the same to shareholders. In addition, the review of complex
   circulars (such as those involving major disposals, privatisations, related party transactions), which are required to be reviewed by us,
   will be fast-tracked. These privileges facilitate faster issuance of circulars to shareholders and thus, expedite faster completion of their
   corporate proposals.

   Following the initial phase of the GLP implementation in August 2017, which identified Qualified PLCs from the top 30 constituents of the
   FBMKLCI, we enhanced the GLP in November 2018 to include constituents of the FBMT100. We also expanded the incentives whereby in
   addition to exempting or fast-tracking the review of complex circulars, we will fast-track processing of other applications by these
   Qualified PLCs.




  ISSUANCE OF COMMUNICATION NOTES ON ISSUES AND OBSERVATIONS RELATING TO PLCs

  In line with our approach to engage and educate market participants, we have been issuing communication notes to provide clarifications and
  illustrations on the application of disclosure requirements under the LR. These communication notes provide best practices, guidance and
  illustrations to help PLCs improve their practices and enhance the standard of disclosure and transparency in the marketplace.

  In 2018 a communication note with regard to corporate disclosure was issued, which set out our observations regarding PLCs’ compliance
  with the disclosure requirements in relation to the content of their website. It also contains recommendations on best practices that PLCs are
  encouraged to adopt in order to maintain a corporate website that is relevant and useful for stakeholders’ decision-making.


In 2018 we continued to achieve timely and reliable submission of financial reports by PLCs, with more than 99% of the reports being submitted
by PLCs within the prescribed timeframe and only five PLCs (as at 31 August 2018) having a variation of more than 10% between their audited
and unaudited financial reports. The number of queries we issued on PLCs’ corporate announcements was reduced substantially compared to
2017, signifying an improvement in the quality of disclosures among PLCs.

T R A DING : EN SU RIN G MARK ET OR D E R L I N E S S
Among our key objectives in 2018 in relation to stakeholders was to enhance market quality through quick, effective and efficient responses
to investor needs. To achieve this objective, we identified and implemented initiatives where we believe investor protection and market
confidence would be best served.

Some of these initiatives were as follows:

    (a) Review and enhancements of the surveillance system and processes
        We embarked on a reorganisation of our surveillance processes to introduce elements of specialisation to improve effectiveness
        and efficiency. We conducted a holistic review on system-triggered alerts based on historical data to ensure our parameters were
        relevant to the current market environment. In addition, we also changed our surveillance system to ensure that we remained
        effective in our surveillance functions.



    (b) Engagements and communications with market participants
        We continued to engage and communicate with our intermediaries in various forms to promote self-regulation and create better
        understanding and greater appreciation of market integrity and an orderly and fair marketplace. This included organising the Market
        Integrity Symposium, engagements with members of the Market Inter-Surveillance Group (MISG) to promote self-regulation in the
        area of front-office surveillance and compliance and issuing guidance on electronic trading.


In 2018 we generally observed a significant improvement in the level of trading supervision by intermediaries. A majority of POs (namely 23
POs representing 94.6% of total value traded in 2018) established and implemented their respective automated surveillance systems. We
believe that this contributed to better and more effective monitoring of trading activities including detection and pre-empting of irregular or
manipulative trades in their respective firms.

More encouragingly, we observed increased communication by intermediaries and adoption of best practices in surveillance methods as
evidenced by the increased number of communications from intermediaries on their front office monitoring observations. This was mainly
attributed to a higher level of compliance awareness and self-regulatory responsibilities, enhancements in supervisory controls and
improvements in the front office monitoring and trade surveillance skills at the level of the POs and TPs.

In enforcing breaches of our rules and to discharge our statutory duty, we ensure appropriate actions are carried out for non-compliances
which may include initiating legal action to effect our enforcement decisions. Enforcement actions may be taken depending on materiality
and/or severity of the breaches, where sanctions may include public or private reprimands, fines, suspensions and/or striking off. For less
serious breaches, management actions such as warning/caution/reminder may be issued. Through these actions, we seek to preserve the
stability and integrity of the market and encourage a strong culture of compliance among market participants.

     We have taken various types of enforcement actions for breaches of our rules over the years, as follows:

       Actions taken against PLCs for breaches of LR                                                                                     27                 37                                  55

       Representatives/Registered Persons for breaches of Business Rules

     We note that there has been a reduction in serious breaches, particularly in the area of reporting of financial information by more than 50%
     since 2008, when we commenced stricter director enforcement action. In this regard, the enforcement of financial reporting breaches and a
     greater emphasis on director enforcement oversight coupled with our continuous communication and education could have contributed to the
     decline of serious breaches.

     We appreciate that creating awareness and understanding through continuous education to PLCs, their directors and advisers, as well as
     their senior management, intermediaries and other registered persons (collectively referred to as the Participants) is key towards enhancing
     the high level of compliance across the capital market as well as promoting a culture of self-regulation.

     We continuously undertake education and other awareness building events with the Participants throughout Malaysia, with some being
     carried out in collaboration with industry institutions and associations to achieve the following key objectives:




        To create awareness of compliance-                                                 To raise Participants’ level of awareness      To provide two-way dialogues where

We recognise that as a regulator and influencer, we possess an opportunity to play an instrumental role, within our sphere of control and
influence, to build the ESG culture among our PLCs. This is done mainly by enabling and enhancing the depth and breadth of ESG information
provided by PLCs to the markets. Quality ESG information benefits not only investors but also a broader group of stakeholders, helping
them measure the long-term resilience of companies and their ability to manage emerging ESG risks and opportunities. On the other hand,
PLCs which place a strong emphasis on ESG reporting are better positioned to reduce their risk and improve their operational and financial
performance.

It is with this in mind that we have adopted a differentiated approach to strengthening the ESG culture among PLCs in recent years.
Our supervision, engagements and advocacy programmes in 2018 have been specifically tailored and targeted to address the distinct needs
and issues faced by PLCs representing different sectors in the areas of CG and sustainability.

          trend is reflected by Malaysia’s significant jump from 7th
          place in the previous ranking in 2016 to 4th place. Malaysia
          was rapidly gaining ground on the other top performers with
          only one percentage point separating it from Singapore (3rd)
          and two percentage points behind Hong Kong (2nd).

          Our persistent efforts at driving CG reforms particularly in
          terms of enhancing the CG practices of our PLCs appeared to
          have further paid off as 14 Malaysian PLCs were recognised

LEAP Market
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a key role in the development of Malaysia’s economy. This market segment contributed
31.7% to total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2017 and comparatively SMEs registered real GDP growth of 6.6% annually between 2004 to
2017 versus 5.1% GDP for the overall economy.

Given that the SMEs account for a majority of Malaysia’s business activities, we launched the LEAP Market, as a key platform for them to take
advantage of our sustainable financing platform for growth. We were the first ASEAN country to have a dedicated platform for this purpose.
It sets us on the right path to champion the space of inclusive and sustainable markets and contribute to a wider economy. The LEAP Market
supports Target 8.3 of SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth.

In 2018, we carried out various initiatives to engage SMEs in considering the LEAP Market as an option for fundraising. Against the backdrop
of economic uncertainties, we were able to record a satisfactory number of listings by SMEs on the LEAP Market in 2018 as a result of
relentless promotion and engagements with stakeholders (refer to the Competition chapter for further details on the progress of our LEAP
Market in 2018). Since its launch, 13 companies have been listed on the LEAP Market, of which 11 were listed in 2018.

Besides creating awareness on LEAP Market, our engagements with SMEs have also provided feedback and challenges they face in
considering public listing particularly on the lack of readiness and cost of listing. We are taking steps to address the issues faced by them.




CLIMATE CHANGE (MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION)
Climate change remains at the forefront of our sustainability concerns. In 2018 we became an official supporter of the TCFD
Recommendations as part of our commitment to addressing climate change issue. The TCFD Recommendations, established by the Financial
Stability Board, represent the first international industry-led initiative aimed at developing voluntary, consistent climate-related financial risk
disclosures by companies in providing information to their lenders, insurers, investors and other stakeholders.

References to the TCFD Recommendations were made in our 2nd Edition Guide & Toolkits to encourage PLCs to assess and disclose material
climate-related information in their annual reporting. Disclosing information on climate risks and opportunities allows PLCs to measure and
respond to trends and ultimately support the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement towards decarbonisation.

     In 2018 we undertook an initiative on palm oil traceability, revising
     the contract specifications for the Ringgit Malaysia Denominated
     Crude Palm Oil Futures (FCPO) Contract and its related contracts.
     All physically delivered Crude Palm Oil (CPO) to Bursa Malaysia
     Derivatives (BMD) must be traceable, marking an important step
     towards promoting sustainable palm oil, which is also in line with
     the Malaysian Government’s efforts in this area. This also caters to
     stakeholder demand for greater transparency on the supply chain of
     palm oil.

     CY BER SEC UR ITY
     As a Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII) identified as such by Majlis Keselamatan Negara (MKN), we are commited to addressing
     cyber threats and risks in a prudent manner, particularly to protect our systems that are exposed to large volumes of data and financial
     transactions.

     As more of our processes and services are conducted online, we become increasingly cautious of cyber threats which may jeopardise the
     integrity, stability, competitiveness and sustainability of our markets. In managing these threats, we conduct periodic reviews of system
     architecture, processes, competencies, expertise and technology, as well as systematically identify and distill key lessons from cyber events
     that have occurred within and outside the organisation to strengthen our resilience.

     We have invested in tools and mechanisms to enhance our cyber resilience capabilities to anticipate, withstand, contain and rapidly recover
     from a cyber incident with the objective of limiting the escalating risks which cyber threats pose to us and our stakeholders. The tools and
     mechanisms are reviewed and assessed to observe the Guidance on Cyber Resilience for Financial Market Infrastructures issued by the
     International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) as well as to comply with the Guidelines on Management of Cyber Risk issued
     by the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC).

     The key cyber security related initiatives undertaken in 2018 were as follows:



             I             Governance

                           As part of our continuous commitment to manage cyber security, we have embarked on ISO27001 - Information Security
                           Management System (ISMS) certifications to limit the impact of information security breaches on our organisation. Commenced
                           in 2012, the ISMS certification is an ongoing process that we embrace to ensure adequate and appropriate security measures
                           have been implemented to protect our organisation’s information assets. This exercise also aims to assure our customers and
                           interested parties that we perform our due diligence proactively with the view to establish a trusted business environment,
                           and that our business systems and processes are kept secure at the core of the ISMS approach. In 2018 we obtained a
                           re-certification of ISMS for our Securities Trading Services, Depository Services and Equity Clearing and Settlement Services.
                           In addition to this, we also secured new certifications for Bursa Suq Al Sila’ (Dealing) Services and Derivative Clearing System.

                       As a continued measure to ensure our environment and system infrastructure are well protected from cyber threats, we
                       have re-designed the architecture of staff internet access and replaced security related components to further strengthen
                       our infrastructure protection and system resilience using the latest cyber threat controls.

          IV                   Awareness and Continuous Improvement
                               Bursa Malaysia Computer Emergency Response Team (BM-CERT), which was established in 2018, is an industry-wide
                               protocol aimed at escalating and sharing cyber security incidences, elevating operational improvement and instilling a culture
                               of managing incident response to cyber threats among the intermediaries. The BM-CERT serves as a platform to enhance
                               cyber security awareness in the industry by providing advisory, guidance and incidents assistance to the Participating
                               Organisations (POs) and Trading Participants (TPs).


     As at 31 December 2018, we continued to maintain our record of zero cyber security incidents. All security threats including viruses, malware
     and attempted intrusions were detected and blocked by the controls that we had already put in place.

     System availability and uptime are important performance factors of our critical IT systems. In 2018 we achieved 100% system availability
     for critical systems. This surpassed the Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.8%. We also observed compliance with the Recovery Time
     Objective (RTO), as prescribed in the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) issued by the Committee on Payments and Market
     Infrastructures (CPMI) and the IOSCO. The present system capacity is sufficient to cater for future growth and is scalable to meet future
     processing needs.



                                                                                           Technology Excellence has the opportunity to transform businesses and markets
                                                                                           and attract capital and talent, which drive investments and in turn, economic

     Technology Excellence is critical to the achievement
     of sustainability. At the organisational level, it                                    1. Bursa Suq Al-Sila’ (BSAS) Rehost and Enhancement Phase 2

     while providing more accurate data and analysis on                                       and reduces turnaround time. BSAS was rehosted to a newer and more efficient

     At the stakeholder level, it unlocks more opportunities                               2. Web-based e-Reporting system
     to engage stakeholders through non-traditional                                           This initiative aimed to automate and facilitate our intermediaries to submit all their
     communication channels and increases stakeholder                                         periodic reports to us with ease. It serves as a “One Stop” platform to accommodate
     scrutiny as data becomes accessible quickly and                                          intermediaries’ submission of their periodic reports and facilitate access to their

                                                                                              system to interface with the e-Reporting system. This interface eliminates human

3. Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)
   The ESB system is the backbone of our system integration which allows flexible communications between our core systems and other
   peripheral systems. It shields the critical core applications from constant changes arising from highly volatile access channels. Services
   which will be integrated to the ESB are anticipated to be highly reusable, allowing for shorter time-to-market for the introduction of new
   customer experience initiatives.

4. Enhanced Human Capital Management System (HCMS)
   New staff performance management and 360-feedback modules are now available online via our enhanced HCMS. The staff performance
   management module documents and rates individual staff capabilities, performance and development in addition to being used as a tool by our staff
   to plan their performance goals and targets for each financial year. The 360-feedback process allows peers, superiors and subordinates to provide
   anonymous feedback to evaluate individual performance. The purpose of the enhanced HCMS is to ensure our employees use the same platform
   and methods of assessment to enable a standardised performance result. This initiative also supports our environmental target to go paperless.




O R G A NISAT ION AL IN N OVATION
Organisational Innovation allows us to cope with rapid changes and implement new organisational methods in the capital market environment
and workplace. As an innovative culture helps an organisation to grow, increase efficiency and maintain its competitive advantage, efforts
were made this year to gear us towards integrating innovative thinking among our workforce (refer to the High-Performance Organisation
chapter of this Report for further details).

Some of the technological innovations our people have made this year included:

BURSASUSTAIN
The development of BURSASUSTAIN as a one-stop knowledge sharing portal took into consideration the needs of our stakeholders for a
suitable infrastructure that was able to offer information, guides and capacity building materials on corporate governance, sustainability and
responsible investment in a holistic manner. The launch of BURSASUSTAIN on 24 April 2018 allowed us to further maximise the impact of our
advocacy programmes by expanding our reach to market participants such as PLCs, investors and other stakeholders in a more engaging and
interactive form such as through videos, webinars, e-learning courses and newsletters.

New Market Surveillance System (MSS)
The MSS plays a key role in our detection of market offences through the alert mechanisms built into the system. This enhances the
effectiveness of our surveillance function by enabling us to expand our detection ability, conduct detailed analysis and report trading
concerns in a timely manner. In 2018 we embarked on the acquisition of a new surveillance system, to facilitate multiple functions including
surveillance, market operations monitoring and control as well as analytical tools for in-depth investigation purposes.

With the new system, we were able to enhance our system capacity and performance in terms of scalability as well as adaptability which
were crucial towards ensuring that we remained effective in a rapidly changing and fast-paced trading environment.

     M OVING FO R WARD
     As we continuously enhance our technology capabilities and improve customer experience, we commenced the development of a portal that will
     link investors directly with us upon its completion in 2020. This initiative recognises the need to modernise our services to transform the customer
     experience in line with digitalisation trends in the financial and capital markets where e-banking and internet trading solutions and customer demand for
     such services are on the rise. The mobile enabled portal will empower investors to manage their Central Depository System (CDS) account information
     online, at their fingertips. It will also provide the investors with value-added information from us advising them on their existing portfolio performances,
     upcoming dividend payments, events, corporate actions and new IPOs that may be of interest to them. At the investors’ convenience, they may also
     choose to conduct transactions through multiple devices. Moving forward, we will continue to innovate, enhance and strengthen our IT systems,
     infrastructures and capabilities within our organisation in line with global best practices as well as to enable successful implementation of our market-
     related initiatives.

     A HPO is driven by the value generated by our workforce, coupled with operational efficiency in the way we work. Our employees anchor the
     sustainability of our business, and we place an emphasis on hiring and retaining the best, while paying attention to their well-being during
     their employment with us. When building our talent pool, we seek individuals who display analytical thinking and innovation, active learning
     strategies, creativity, emotional intelligence, leadership and problem-solving skills in addition to other key skills.

     In our efforts to be an employer of choice, we aim to provide an environment where our people can grow their careers and progress above
     and beyond their initial skills and capabilities. We are also committed to being an inclusive and equal opportunity employer which safeguards
     the interests of all our employees as we seek to maintain an engaged, high-performing and productive workforce.

     day decisions in the environment they operate in. In this regard, we strive to ensure that the policies and workplace initiatives in place enable
     our people to do good.

To inculcate an engaged and productive workforce, we seek to create a strong workplace culture that actively addresses health and
well-being. The physical, mental and emotional wellness of our employees are crucial elements to our sustainability efforts as our people are
the first to be impacted by any decision we make.

We demonstrate our commitment to OSH by meeting and exceeding the relevant regulations and voluntary codes. Our OSH initiatives are
overseen by our OSH Committee, which is made up of representatives from our management team and our workforce. The composition of this
OSH Committee can be found on page 75. This OSH Committee was tasked to develop, endorse and evaluate the quality and effectiveness of
our OSH policies which are currently measured through injury rate, occupational disease rate, lost day rate and work-related fatalities. All the
indicators mentioned currently stand at zero. An additional measurement of the effectiveness of our OSH policies are absentee rates which
are provided on page 76.

We have introduced several safety and security measures for the benefit of our employees. These included providing clear procedures in
reporting and responding to any threat or safety incidents to our staff who carry out high-risk job functions or roles. This was prompted
by the unfortunate attack on one of our staff members on his way home in June this year. In response, we further heightened our security
measures within our premises and implemented additional enhancements to the safety procedures for all employees. For example, we
stationed security personnel at our headquarters’ main exit points during peak hours, namely, in the morning when staff arrive for work, at
lunchtime and in the evening when staff leave work to ensure our premises remained secure amid the higher flow of foot traffic.

We also strictly screened visitors at the main building entry points, especially visitors intending to see staff at the work place. To further
enhance security access control, we installed pedestrian barriers at the ground floor which restrict indiscriminate access to our main
building. Additionally, we conducted crime awareness programmes for our staff to help increase their awareness on personal safety and
crime prevention activities.

In caring for the well-being of our employees, we conducted various activities throughout the year. These included the Eco-Carnival 2018
which comprised talks, shows and classes to expose our employees to ways to achieve a healthy lifestyle. It also included an Eco Treasure
Hunt where employees were required to go outdoor, use the Light Rail Transit (LRT) to solve treasure hunt clues and create objects from only
recycled materials.

We also house a well-equipped gym which is open to employees before work, during lunch and after work to allow them to exercise and
remain fit. There are also facilities for yoga, Zumba, aerobics and other exercise programmes for employees. Additionally, our employees are
encouraged to participate and represent Bursa Malaysia in our Bursa Bull Charge (BBC) event.

In September 2018, we conducted a health screening event for all our employees, enabling them to undertake check-ups at the office instead
of going to the hospital.

To accord flexibility for our employees, we provide alternative arrangements to our standard working hours which our staff can opt into. This
move demonstrates our efforts in encouraging a work/life balance for our people and eliminating excessive working hours.

     Our water consumption data for 2017 was restated as
     November and December water consumption data were
     not available at the point of 2017 sustainability reporting
     and hence were estimated based on past data trends. This
     total water withdrawal was inclusive of our tenants’ water
     consumption.


The marked reduction in our water withdrawal
recorded in 2018 which amounted to 16,302m3 (29%)
was a result of the relocation of one of our tenants in
2017. In 2018, our premises were only occupied by
                                                                                                                                                               455

     BURSA BULL CHARGE
     Our annual charity run, the Bursa Bull Charge 2018 (BBC 2018) was organised for the fifth year in 2018 and saw captains of industries,
     partners of Bursa Malaysia and capital market players participating to help raise funds for the communities we support. This year’s run, held
     on 27 September 2018, attracted almost 1,500 runners from over 100 organisations across corporate Malaysia, successfully raising over
     RM2.1 million for distribution through Yayasan Bursa Malaysia to 22 beneficiary organisations. Our involvement in the BBC is ultimately aimed
     at contributing towards sustainable development on a national scale over the long term.

     To mark its fifth-year milestone, the BBC 2018 was anchored on a sub-theme of supporting six of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
     to enhance our continuous pursuit of championing sustainability across the capital market. The six SDGs, the first five of which are put
     forward by the Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) Initiative as relevant for stock exchanges to support, are SDG5: Gender Equality,
     SDG8: Good Jobs and Economic Growth, SDG12: Responsible Consumption, SDG13: Climate Action, SDG17: Partnerships for the Goals and
     SDG4: Quality Education.

     In line with our support for the SDGs, the BBC 2018 encouraged more participation from women and veterans, with the event entertainment
     being performed by differently-abled persons. We also introduced a new category for para runners. These efforts were all aimed at enhancing
     the inclusiveness of the event. We were committed to reducing the environmental impact of the event and took deliberate steps to reduce
     our waste footprint by avoiding single-use plastic products and food surplus, alongside promoting the concept of Reducing, Reusing and
     Recycling (3R). Among these initiatives included promoting the use of reusable containers and stainless steel cutleries, providing bins for
     recycling water bottles and tin cans, routing food surplus from the run to the Pertiwi Soup Kitchen and Rumah Titian Kasih and using social
     media to communicate our sustainability efforts and encourage participants to support the run’s sustainability initiatives.

     This year, over 35 different types of CSR initiatives were organised
     for our staff. These CSR initiatives were developed and planned

     engagements and maximise our collective impact. The CSR initiatives
     included:

     We recorded a strong staff participation this year with 576 employees
     participating in at least one CSR initiative. At an aggregate level,
     employees recorded a total of 7,075 volunteer hours this year.

     MOVING FORWARD
     As we continue to empower the communities through our existing CSR programmes such as the BBC and scholarships, we will search for
     new ways to maximise the contribution and presence of Yayasan Bursa Malaysia as an impactful charitable foundation in Malaysia.
     This may include adopting a globally-recognised standard to measure, manage and communicate the impact of our community investments
     more effectively and using the information as a basis to formulate our community investment strategy moving forward. We will also seek to
     intensify our collaboration with BBC beneficiaries and external organisations on projects that promote financial literacy, entrepreneurship and
     other key causes in line with Yayasan Bursa Malaysia’s objectives.

 which have been assessed to have good conduct and are familiar with
 the relevant regulatory requirements to commence their activities through
 notification to (as opposed to seeking approval from) Bursa Malaysia. The
 policy shortens the time to market for equities and derivatives brokers
 to commence their new activities which include the opening of new
 branches, commencement of discretionary trading, proprietary trading,
 margin financing and dual licensed activities. Green Lane Policy for public
 listed companies (PLCs) relating to circulars is a differentiated approach
 adopted in Bursa Malaysia’s review of draft circulars submitted by PLCs.
 This is premised on the PLCs standard of corporate governance conduct
 and disclosure practices. The policy is an incentive granted to PLCs which
 have been assessed to have good corporate governance and disclosure
 practices thus accorded certain privileges which among others facilitated
 faster issuance of circulars to shareholders and hence, expedites
 completion of corporate proposals.
