1   About This Statement

    In line with the amendments to the Main Market Listing Requirements on sustainability reporting issued by Bursa Malaysia
    Securities Berhad in October 2015, 7-Eleven Malaysia Holdings Berhad (“Group”) is proud to present our inaugural
    sustainability statement. The Group is currently the owner and operator of over 2,000 convenience stores in Malaysia through
    its subsidiary 7-Eleven Malaysia Sdn. Bhd (“7-Eleven” or “Company”).

    The statement covers 7-Eleven’s sustainability effort from 1st January 2017 to 31st December 2017 unless specified otherwise.
    The scope of this statement includes the Company’s operations at its headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, its 2,225 convenience
    stores located throughout Malaysia including Sarawak and Sabah, its Store Support Centre (SSC) and its Central Distribution
    Centre (CDC) located in Shah Alam.

    The geographic boundary concerning the supply chain activities extend from the CDC located in Shah Alam to the following
    cross dock hubs: Kota Bharu (East Coast 1 Cross Dock), Penang (Northern Cross Dock), Kuantan (East Cost 2 Cross Dock) and
    Johor (Southern Cross Dock).

    This statement was prepared in accordance with the G4 Reporting Guidelines published by the Global Reporting Initiative
    (GRI). Throughout this statement, we have provided insights on the approaches and strategies that we have undertaken to
    integrate sustainability across our operations.

2   Sustainability Strategy and Road Map

    In September 2015, the United Nation’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were unveiled and affirmed by 193
    member states including Malaysia. We support the aspirations of the United Nations and the Government of Malaysia and on
    our part, aspire to integrate elements of the SDGs into our approach towards improving our sustainability performance.

     2.1 Sustainability Strategy

        In embarking upon this journey to improve our economic, environmental and social (EES) performance, we have developed
        a three-pronged strategy which involves: Empowering Customers, Leading by Example and Working with Others.

          Empowering Customers                             Leading by Example                  Working with Others

           ∙     Ramping up the                        ∙    Reducing Energy                    ∙   Networking with NGOs
                 E-Commerce Platform                        Consumption
                                                                                               ∙   Building Resilient
           ∙     Green Consumerism                     ∙    Reducing Greenhouse                    Communities
                                                            Gas (GHG) Emissions



     Empowering Customers ‘to Protect the Environment’
     By encouraging e-commerce and identifying ways in which our customers can halve their personal and domestic carbon
     footprints. We are ramping up our e-commerce platform to have more in-store services, which include top-ups for Touch
     and Go, mobile phone reloads and utility bills payment. These in-store services already account for about 3% of 7-Eleven’s
     revenue and about 10% of gross profit.

    2.1 Sustainability Strategy (cont’d)

       Leading by Example
       We put the environment at the heart of most things we do. We are committed to a long-term programme involving
       practical steps to reduce our energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

       Working with Others ‘for Sustainable Partnerships’
       By networking with NGOs, universities and other community organisations, and through our contributions towards
       the community, 7-Eleven Malaysia endeavours to build strength and resilience amongst vulnerable communities. From
       supporting pioneers of NGO causes to aiding the disadvantaged during times of need, we uphold high standards of
       behaviour and integrity towards such efforts.

3   Governance Structure

    Sustainability governance is the foundation on which an organisation’s sustainability strategy is built as it ensures the
    strengthening of external stakeholder relations, the management of reporting processes and goal-setting, and overall
    accountability. A robust governance structure supported by committed leadership, clear direction and strategic influence, is
    essential for the successful integration and effective management of sustainability throughout the organisation.

    With this in mind, 7-Eleven has established a Sustainability Committee (SC) to formulate policies towards improving its
    sustainability performance and to assist and advise the Board on policies regarding sustainability matters. The Committee
    comprises Head of Departments (HOD) of the following 7-Eleven departments: Supply Chain; Marketing; Human Resources;
    Fresh Food Services; Franchise and Store Administration; Procurement; and Maintenance. This ensures that decisions are
    taken at the right level of the business by the people best placed to take them.

    The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is the SC’s Chairman and the General Manager (GM) of Franchise and Store Administration;
    the Sustainability Coordinator. The Sustainability Coordinator engages the departments in the Committee to oversee the
    cross-departmental sustainability projects and encourage new ideas contributing towards the improvement of the Company’s
    sustainability performance. The SC plans to meet thrice a year or upon the requisition of its Chairman and in the absence of
    the Chairman, the Sustainability Co-ordinator shall chair the meeting.

4    Stakeholder Engagement

     Our stakeholders are those who can affect and be affected by our organisation’s actions, objectives and policies. We have
     identified our main stakeholders to be our investors, customers, regulatory agencies and statutory bodies. Other stakeholders
     include employees, suppliers and NGOs. By regularly engaging with our stakeholders, we are able to identify the materialities
     that matter most to them, which inturn helps improve our decision-making and accountability. We discussed and selected our
     main stakeholders during workshops and then prioritised them based on the stakeholder’s degree of influence on our business
     operations and degree of interest.

5   Identifying Materiality

    Our Material Sustainability Matters

    Materiality assessment is the process of identifying and prioritising the material sustainability matters that influence the
    way we operate. As a first step, we selected our material matters using the process described in the Sustainability Reporting
    Guide published by Bursa Malaysia and identified the key indicators. The identified material matters were then prioritised
    by ranking them according to their importance to our stakeholders and our business operation. These rankings were then
    used to derive 7-Eleven’s materiality matrix as shown below.




                                                                                               Economic Matters

6    Food Responsibility and Quality Assurance

     We have introduced our home brand ‘Fresh To Go’ and have created a wide variety of fresh and ready-to-eat (RTE) scrumptious
     food for our customers. An effective Quality Assurance (QA) system ensures the food is safe for consumption and for this reason,
     extends to the suppliers and vendors, and involves regular inspection and audits. The relation between quality and safety is
     intricate and although safety cannot be viewed as a totally independent aspect from quality, recognising the complexity of
     both allows us to place specific checks and measures towards building a comprehensive QA system.

6   Food Responsibility and Quality Assurance (cont'd)

    Food Safety and Quality
    We have adopted several international management system standards and management techniques concerning quality and
    hygiene in order to provide safe and reliable food products to our customers. 7-Eleven’s QA system in ensuring the quality
    and safety of its home brand products (‘Fresh To Go’) includes the prerequisites such as Good Manufacturing Practice
    (GMP),Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), quality management systems such as MS 1500:2009, internal
    food manufacturing standards such 7EFMS, and integrated systems such as ISO 22000:2005.

    Food Labelling
    Many consumers actively seek information about products that have qualities that serve their health needs and are consistent
    with their values. As a result of these varied interests, food labels are increasingly being used to provide consumers with
    information about the environmental, technical and socioeconomic conditions under which the products were produced,
    as well as the health and safety aspects of food products. At best, labels are part of the environment that enables consumers
    to make food choices according to their needs and desires.

    At 7-Eleven, we adhere to the Food Act 1983 (Act 281) and Regulations Part IV Labelling as stipulated by Malaysia’s
    Food Regulations 1985, which require ‘Fresh To Go’ products to disclose the sourcing of components, substances that
    potentially cause environmental/social impact, the safe use of the product and service and the disposal of the product and
    its environmental/social impact. The shelf life of the ‘Fresh To Go’ products are labelled after proper lab analysis. A total of
    5 microbiological parameters and 3 physical parameters are monitored consistently. To ensure the safety of the products,
    we conservatively reduce the shelf life of the products by shortening the expiry date by 1-2 days depending on the product.

7   Our Economy - Contributing towards economic sustainability

    Supporting and investing in the local economy are an important part in our efforts to strengthen sustainability throughout our
    operations. This section covers 7-Eleven’s existing sustainable practices in areas of remuneration, hiring and procurement,
    all of which are key aspects of sustainability.

    7.1 Standard Entry Level Wage

       7-Eleven complies with Malaysia’s Minimum Wages Order 2016 which stipulates that an employee shall be paid an
       average minimum wage of not less than RM 1,000 per month in Peninsular Malaysia and in the case of East Malaysia RM
       920 per month, regardless of age and gender.

    7.2 Hiring of Senior Management from Local Community

       We prefer to hire from the local community in order to provide opportunities for suitably qualified and experienced
       personnel in senior leadership positions to gain experience and benchmark their performance with world-class leaders.
       Furthermore, as locals they understand and are aware of the retail industry of our country, taking into account the
       diversity that exists within the multi-racial population.

        We have a Procurement Policies and Procedures Handbook and purchasing guidelines which we follow when choosing
        our vendors. We expect vendors to execute environment protection and perform CSR activities to improve our total supply
        chain performance and keep it sustainable. We strive to enhance the integrity of our supply chain through good and
        sustainable procurement practices.

8    Our People - Creating a safe and sustainable workplace for our employees

     We recognise that our employees are our greatest asset and embedding sustainability throughout our value chain, involves
     providing opportunities and incentives to our employees to build and harness their potential.

     8.1 Inclusive and Engaging Workplace

        Employee Well-Being
        We place a high value on the contribution of each employee and we continuously work to meet their needs and concerns
        at the workplace. This includes engaging them so that they feel a sense of belonging to the Company, motivating them
        to take ownership of their roles and responsibilities, respecting the need for work-life integration, and paying attention to
        their well-being.

        Apart from a set of standard benefits including bonus, medical coverage, insurance benefits and contribution to the
        employees’ provident fund scheme under the Employees Provident Fund Act 1991, we also provide a range of financial
        assistance and subsidies for eligible employees. No gender-specific criteria are taken into account when assessing
        remuneration and work activities.

        Communication
        We developed 7-Eleven Wiki, our Company intranet to create an online communication channel to circulate the latest
        news, file access and important processes that are vital to every employee’s daily work. 7-Eleven Wiki helps bridge the
        gap between different departments, and between the top management and the rest of the organisation. The long-term
        goal is to improve the internal communication within 7-Eleven to cultivate a strong work ethic and to promote greater
        administrative efficiency.

        Diversity and Inclusiveness
        These elements are built into the work culture at 7-Eleven. The Board’s Diversity Policy encourages that Directors appointed
        by the Company, bring with them the requisite skills and experience to enable the Company to realise its corporate
        strategies and objective, regardless of gender, age or ethnicity. The current composition of the Board demonstrates our
        Diversity Policy as it has a diverse mix of Directors across gender, age and ethnicity, and together, reflect a whole gamut
        of different industry backgrounds, skills, experience and expertise.

    8.1 Inclusive and Engaging Workplace (cont'd)

       Senior Management Commitment
       At 7-Eleven, Senior Management regularly engages with our employees in order to identify their needs and concerns,
       to encourage camaraderie and to reinforce a sense of unity among employees across all levels. We look to hire young
       talent to build an energetic team that is passionate, creative and equipped with new ideas and modern thinking, who can
       prepare the organisation for future challenges and opportunities.

    8.2 Business Transparency

       We are committed to transparency, integrity, impartiality and accountability in the conduct of our business and affairs.
       Corruption raises transaction costs, undermines fair competition, impedes long-term foreign and domestic investment,
       and distorts development priorities. As a measure to protect our employees and the Company from such risk, we have
       established a Whistleblowing Policy and Gift Policy, and as a measure against verbal or physical harassment at the
       workplace, we have a Grievance Channel. In 2017, 34 cases were reported and resolved. These cases were a combination
       of salary grievances, whistle-blower and other industrial relation matters.

    8.3 Human Capital Development

       Towards embracing sustainability and building a diverse as well as effective workforce, we aim to create a workplace
       environment that is encouraging, healthy, fair and competitive for all our employees regardless of gender, race or age.
       Currently, the strength of our workforce stands at 14,778, of which women comprise 51% and men 49%.

    8.4 Women at the Workplace

       We believe in encouraging women at the workplace and providing opportunities for talented women to progress throughout
       the Company, particularly to the ranks of Senior Management. The percentage of women within Senior Management is
       23% while that of men is 77%, giving us a male to female ratio of 3:1. In Malaysia, studies1 undertaken in 2016 reveal that
       the percentage of women in top management positions across the top 100 Public Listed Companies increased to 28.4%.
       This trend is encouraging and by creating opportunities for growth for our potential female employees we aim to improve
       the male to female ratio within our Senior Management.

     8.5 Building Talent

        Identifying the gaps in knowledge and skills is the first step to identifying our training needs and through training programmes
        we aim to fill these gaps, thereby enabling employees to develop their skills, improve talent retention and employee work
        performance. The in-house programmes we organise for our employees towards skill management and life-long learning
        include Health and Wellness, Think Global Act Local, Careers Edition and Design Thinking. These are seminars that we
        have conducted for our employees, each lasting about 1.5 hours and attended by an average of 30 employees.

         Training Programme                  Description
         Health and Wellness                 Creating awareness amongst employees on health, including areas such as genetics
                                             and hereditary health, general health awareness, DNA versus diet, and lifestyle
                                             versus health.
         Think Global Act Local              Based on the knowledge that in emerging economies like Asia, where demographic
                                             trends offer more potential for growth than developed markets, we must tailor our
                                             products to local demands in order for our brand to do well. In 2017, the Senior
                                             Regional Director of 7-Eleven International (South East Asia and Pacific) shared
                                             his thoughts and experiences with our employees on the importance of thinking
                                             globally and acting locally.
         Careers Edition                     Providing a platform for Management and others with experience to share their
                                             personal career journey with 7-Eleven employees, to inspire them and encourage
                                             them to avail of opportunities provided by 7-Eleven to further their career
                                             development. In 2017, the General Manager of Supply Chain shared his career
                                             experiences of working in different sections of 7-Eleven Malaysia’s Supply Chain.
         Design Thinking                     Encouraging our employees to be creative, innovative and to think ‘out-of-the-box’
                                             in running their day-to-day activities. This seminar employs a multidisciplinary
                                             team and a flexible environment to promote a creative process and generate user
                                             focused products, services and experiences

        We have a similar process in place for identifying our external training needs. Our main external training programmes
        include seminars, conferences and summits covering areas that are pertinent to our business such as leadership training,
        human resources, supply chain management, food safety, merchandising, e-learning, auditing and foreign workers’
        management.

    8.6 Performance Appraisal

       At 7-Eleven, all employees receive regular performance appraisal and as a measure it ensures that they are provided with
       a sustainable environment in which they can develop their skills and performance. Annual performance review along with
       intermittent progress checks between the employee and his or her Manager has the following benefits:

       ∙     Reinforces good job performance
       ∙     Helps improve unsatisfactory job performance
       ∙     Makes sure employees and Managers understand each other’s expectations
       ∙     Allows employees and Managers to create goals, as well as plans to achieve those goals
       ∙     Improves communication between Managers and staff members

    8.7 Job Rotation

       Job rotation is considered an effective HR strategy tool as it helps identify which position or place within the Company is
       suited for an employee for him or her to deliver their best. Employees are moved through a variety of assignments to gain
       awareness about the actual working style of the organisation and to understand the challenges that develop at every stage.
       Furthermore, it is the strategy we use to find the immediate replacement for a high-worth employee, when needed, from
       within the organisation. The benefits of job rotation are as follows:


           Helps                 Helps              Identifies         Motivates            Increases          Helps align
        Managers               employees           knowledge,        employees to          satisfaction       competencies

    8.8 Occupational Health and Safety

       The World Economic Forum posits that the most competitive organisations are also the safest (World Economic Forum,
       2002). By complying with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) 1994, formulating a
       comprehensive safety and health policy and providing extra protection for the disabled, 7-Eleven ensures the safety and
       health of its employees and customers.

     8.8 Occupational Health and Safety (cont'd)

           At the corporate level, we have established an Occupational Safety and Health (“OSH”) Committee as stipulated by
           Malaysia’s Safety and Health Committee Regulations 1996. The functions of the OSH Committee include:

           ∙   Assisting in the development of safety and health rules and safe systems of work;
           ∙   Reviewing the effectiveness of safety and health programmes;
           ∙   Carrying out studies on the trends of accident, near-miss accident, dangerous occurrence, occupational poisoning or
               disease, and reporting to the employer together with recommendations for corrective actions; and
           ∙   Reviewing the safety and health policies.

           The Committee consists of a Chairman, Secretary (Safety and Health Officer), Employer Representatives and Employee
           Representatives. Our OSH Committee has 27 members, of which 12 are employer representatives (Branch Managers),
           another 12 are employee representatives and the remaining 3 include the Secretary, the Assistant Secretary and the
           Chairman. The percentage of OSH employees of the total workforce is 0.3%. In 2017, there have been no incidents of
           injury reportable to the Department of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH).

9    Our Community - Creating sustainable partnerships to build resilience amongst vulnerable communities

     Responsibility is a value that has always been implemented across all aspects of our operations and led us to uphold our
     position as the leader of the Malaysian convenience store chain industry till date. Each year, we aspire to improve and
     commit ourselves to strengthening responsible behaviour in order to garner a positive influence not only on the local
     economy and on the corporate world but also on our surrounding communities. We were honoured to receive the ‘Company
     of the Year Award (Retail Category) for Pioneering Corporate Social Initiatives’ during the CSR Malaysia Awards 2017.
     7-Eleven was recognised as an outstanding corporation in Malaysia that has excelled in the role of change agents in the
     socio-economic transformation of Malaysia.

10 Our Environment - Building measures to foster environmental sustainability

    10.1 Use of Light Emitting Diode (LED) Lighting in Stores

         LED lights are more energy-efficient and reduces the use of hazardous materials as compared to conventional lights.
         We started a project with General Electric in November 2015 to replace conventional lights in 7-Eleven stores with
         LED lights. 33 stores that replaced their lights to LED under this project were monitored for 6 months. During the first
         phase of monitoring (within 2-3 months of installation), 9.5% of energy reduction (average consumption of 36.5 kWh
         per store per day) was recorded. Further monitoring of 22 of the same stores for up to 6 months showed a total of 16%
         of energy reduction (average consumption of 56.23 kWh per store per day) for all chain stores.

                                                 Reduction in Electricity Consumption

                                             2015                                        2017

                                   36.5 kWh per store per day                56.23 kWh per store per day


    10.2 Replacement of Slurpee Machines

         We seek to utilise energy-efficient machines in 7-Eleven stores to reduce our energy consumption. In 2016, Slurpee
         machines in 7-Eleven stores were replaced with smaller Table Top Slurpee machines. The smaller Table Top Slurpee
         machines uses new innovative technology and specifications that increase energy efficiency and has reduced energy
         consumption by 30%. The refrigeration process of the new Slurpee machines runs more efficiently and its smaller
         compressor requires less energy to operate. The new machines use the latest ES Software which provides better control
         over the auto-defrost process and operation of the machine.

         The replacement of Slurpee machines shows a decrease of 3.6 kWh per day, which is 21% less energy that what was
         consumed prior to replacement. Up until July, we installed 179 units of new Slurpee machines, and by the end of year
         2017, we are targeting to install 200 units and thereby potentially saving a fraction of 7-Eleven’s operating cost.

     10.3 Installed Energy Saving Device on Chiller and Air-Conditioner

          In 2015, we engaged an energy consultant to install energy monitoring devices on air-conditioners and chillers on a
          pilot–scale (20 stores) which ensure the air-conditioners and chillers operate in a more efficient way. We monitored
          the energy consumption of the 20 stores and the results were significant with improved performance and an average
          energy consumption reduction of 32 kWh per store per day. The plan to install energy monitoring devices on air-
          conditioners and chillers in 300 of our stores in 2018 is currently in the final stage of negotiation.

     10.4 Greenhouse Gas Emissions

          The 7-Eleven CDC in Shah Alam has taken the initiative to reduce its carbon emissions with the introduction of the
          Cross Dock Project. Initially, 5-tonne trucks were used in the CDC to deliver products to all our stores across the
          country. This delivery method was not environmentally friendly as it produced high carbon emissions.

          As a result, we replaced the 5-tonne trucks with 1 long haul truck (40 ft.) to deliver the goods to 4 cross dock hubs
          in Kota Bharu (East Coast 1 Cross Dock), Penang (Northern Cross Dock), Kuantan (East Cost 2 Cross Dock) and Johor
          (Southern Cross Dock). The local feeder trucks then collect the goods from the cross-dock hubs and deliver to the
          7-Eleven stores in those regions. By reducing the frequency of trips, this initiative has reduced carbon emissions that
          would have otherwise been emitted and reduced costs as well as traffic congestion and has created a more efficient
          logistic management system. A total of 680.7 tonnes of carbon emission savings was recorded in 2016 after the
          implementation of the Cross-Dock Project.

          The total CO2 emissions savings by the 4 cross docks from January to September 2017 is represented in the graph
          below. The data is obtained by comparing the mileage and CO2 emission rate using the previous 5-tonne trucks and
          after implementing the cross dock delivery model. If we had continued with the previous delivery model, 3318.85
          tonnes of CO2 would have been emitted. A total of 1790.64 tonnes of CO2 was reduced throughout the 9 months of
          implementation, which shows that the new delivery model successfully lowered the CO2 emissions by 53.95 %.

   10.5 Replacement of Dry Ice with Cooler Gel

         In October 2015, we decided to replace the dry ice packs with cooler gel for the delivery of confectionary products
         to chain stores in the CDC. Our intention of replacing dry ice with cooler gel is to reduce energy consumption and
         operational cost as it can be reused, and to initiate environmentally friendly practices towards reducing CO2 emissions.
         Unlike cooler gel, dry ice is required to be ordered on every confectionery delivery day as it cannot be reused. Ice packs
         using the cooler gel, on the other hand, can be reused by freezing them 72 hours before the next delivery.

         The total cost savings achieved as a result of switching from dry ice packs to those using cooler gels between January
         2016 and January 2017 is estimated to be RM 358,313 after the deduction of initial costs (which includes implementation
         costs such as the cost of chest freezers, wires and ice packs). In 2017, the total savings after the substitution of dry ice
         with cooler gel is RM 189,232.46 considering the initial investment depreciation, which gave us an average total saving
         of 87% in terms of cost saved and weight of dry ice saved (not used).

   10.6 Waste Recycling

         Recycling is one of the ways to protect our environment as it reduces the amount of waste that goes to the landfill. Along
         with using innovative technology towards improving energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions, we also practise
         recycling, all of which improves our economic and environmental sustainability performance.

         Corrugated carton boxes and plastic waste are continuously being generated as waste at the CDC. There is a total of 180
         suppliers delivering goods in bulk packages to the CDC where they are repacked before delivery to the 7-Eleven chain
         stores. The carton boxes and plastic wastes are sold to local recyclers.
