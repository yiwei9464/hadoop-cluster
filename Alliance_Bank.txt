                       Female                              The Bank conducts an employee survey called “Voice of Employee” on a quarterly basis. The

                                                           We continue to push for proactive employee engagement, such as with the weekly “Huddle”
                                                           sessions. At these sessions, employees are encouraged to discuss and reflect on different
                                                           issues within the Bank. These huddles have led to further developmental breakthroughs.

                                                the organisational layers, and to better understand the sentiments of
                                                employees at the grassroots.

                                                The ideas that spring from these huddles are collated and shared with
                                                Senior Management members to be selected for implementation. This
                                                creates a sense of inclusiveness and ownership among the staff. This
                                                also means that their voice has a role in influencing the practices and
                                                policies in the Bank.

                                                We also have the “Allies of Alliance” portal, which features an “Ideas
                                                Bank” for employees to contribute and discuss new ideas at work.
                                                These ideas are assessed and help to create more sustainable and
                                                responsive processes and systems within the Bank.

                                                To drive employee engagement at the Bank, we have set up an
