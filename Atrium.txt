FOSTERING STRONG RELATIONSHIPS 
As we have embarked on Atrium's journey, we have focused our attention in fostering strong relationships, with tenants, 
unitholders and property manager. 
The quality of existing assets and its services must be maintained at the highest level to ensure tenant satisfaction and 
retention. Periodic meetings are conducted with tenants to determine their satisfactions levels. Also, bi-annual visits are 
performed together with the property manager to ensure that the Manager is meeting the expectation of Atrium REIT's 
tenants. 
Relationship with unitholders are maintained via the updates provided during the Annual General Meeting (AGM) as well 
as periodic meetings as and when they are required for further updates. 
In maintaining and fostering the abovementioned relationships, we ensure it is highly sustainable with regards to the REIT's 
going concern. 
HEALTH AND SAFETY 
Atrium's management will ensure that every reasonable precaution will be taken to ensure health and safety of our 
employees and of those engaged in business activities on our properties. No job is regarded to be so urgent that health 
and safety is compromised. 
The Property Manager (Hartamas Asset Management Sdn Bhd — HAMSB) conducts bi-annual building inspections with 
representatives from the Manager and the tenants to highlight the status and condition of maintenance of facilities within 
the properties. 
Dedicated personnel are allocated by the Property Manager to each property to encourage proper action in attending to 
tenant related matters.

Annual Report 2018 51 
Sustainability Statement (cont'd) 
To date, Atrium REIT has carried out the following Asset Enhancement Initiatives (AEI) to generate better yields, maintain 
occupancy, and create a better operating business environment for our tenants as well as to enhance property condition 
and value. 
ATRIUM SHAH ALAM 3 
The AEI of upgrading the facility from an old factory to a Grade A logistics warehouse involved the following: 
Constructing a new raised warehouse floor slab and installing loading bays and dock levelers for the ease and speed 
in loading and unloading of good; and 
Raising the warehouse height so that the tenant could install pallet racking system to fully utilise the vertical storage 
space. 
Replacing the warehouse lightings to a more energy efficient lighting system. 
ENVIRONMENT 
In conjunction with being more environmental friendly, Atrium has placed reminders at water outlet areas, electrical 
switches, and print stations to communicate the importance of conservation and the management's direction, tone and 
view on minimizing the impact to the environment. 
We constantly remind our employees to save paper and always print on both sides. Email footers have been enhanced to 
include "think before you print" reminders. 
The additional AEI that has been undertaken by Atrium to be sustainable environmentally are as follows: 
Changing the entire warehouse to the T-5 lighting system that is more energy efficient and cooler compare to the 
traditional highbay lighting system; and 
Changing the roof to dual clip system to reduce potential water leakages as well as providing better insulation to 
reduce overall heat in the warehouse. 
By undergoing these AEIs Atrium has reduced the wastage of energy and water, hence in line with leading an environmentally 
sustainable vision.
