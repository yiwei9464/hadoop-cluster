2018 was Shell’s 25 anniversary in India since our re-
entry into the country in 1993. Our links with India go
back much further – to 1928. Today, Shell sees India as
an important growth market, as a hub for innovation and
a source of world-class talent.

We are working with our partners to deliver more and
cleaner energy solutions – in a way that integrates
environmental and social considerations – as India’s
population grows and living standards rise. We plan to
significantly expand in the country by offering customers
a range of more energy-efficient, lower emission fuels
and lubricants, natural gas and renewable energy for
power generation and biofuels.

The country has a series of goals for both changing the
kinds of energy it uses and increasing energy access to
rural communities. For instance, the government has set
several targets, including increasing the share of natural
gas in the primary energy mix from 6.5% today to 15%
in 2030.

The Hazira LNG port and terminal in Gujarat – which
Shell Gas B.V. acquired in early 2019 – is one of the
largest ever international investments in India’s energy
sector. Plans are also under way to expand the number        A ship delivers a cargo of liquefied natural gas to the Hazira

We are involved in six shale plays in the Americas and
expect the shales business to become a significant
growth priority for Shell in the next decade.

In 2018, we focused on production growth at the SWEPI
LP (a subsidiary of Shell Oil Company) light tight oil
facilities in the Permian Basin in the USA and our facilities
at Fox Creek in Canada, bringing new wells online and
investing in supporting infrastructure.                                    Drones use onboard sensors and cameras to collect

In 2018, Shell and its partner Avitas Systems, were the
first in the USA to gain approval for flying commercial
drones beyond visual line of sight with the support of
radar, which enables next generation detection
technology such as surveillance drones.




Shell is testing drones in the Permian Basin to survey infrastructure across vast stretches of land faster than ever before.

The world gets most of its energy from coal, oil and gas, with around a fifth of all energy used to generate electricity. Energy sources differ across
industry, transport and domestic use, which all need to transition to low-carbon options.

environmental management plans to avoid, manage or
mitigate potential effects on the environment. The
project’s wetland compensation plan includes
establishing 17 hectares of wetlands to help balance the
project's physical presence. The plan includes hiring an
environmental specialist contractor to restore, enhance or
create another 65 hectares of wetlands.

LNG Canada also plans to offset project-related impact
on fish and fish habitats by maintaining or increasing the
availability and quality of rearing, migratory and winter
habitats for the local salmon, trout, and char populations.

                                 In 2018, we started work on 260 R&D projects with

                                 emissions) can be reduced by as much as 8%.

                                 In 2018, we announced a new programme that will help

and other properties, and caused many people in
Groningen to feel unsafe. We are working with our

[A] Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) comprise carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride. The data are calculated using
    locally regulated methods where they exist. Where there is no locally regulated method, the data are calculated using the 2009 API Compendium, which is the recognised industry standard under the
    GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. There are inherent limitations to the accuracy of such data. Oil and gas industry guidelines (IPIECA/API/IOGP) indicate that several
    sources of uncertainty can contribute to the overall uncertainty of a corporate emissions inventory. We have estimated the overall uncertainty of our direct GHG emissions to be around 2%. 2015-2018
    emissions are calculated using Global Warming Potential factors from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report. Data for prior years were calculated using Global Warming Potential factors from the IPCC’s
    Second Assessment Report.
[B] These emissions were calculated using the market-based method in line with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.
[C] The term upstream in this context includes assets and activities from our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses.
[D] Nigeria includes SPDC onshore operations (0.5 million tonnes flared in 2018) and SNEPCo offshore operations (0.3 million tonnes flared in 2018).
[E] Flaring from the Majnoon field in Iraq and from Malaysia amounted to 0.4 and 0.1 million tonnes of hydrocarbons respectively in 2018.
[F] Methodology was updated in 2012. Data for prior years are not directly comparable.
[G] Data are indexed to 2002, based on Solomon Associates Energy Intensity Index 2006 methodology.
[H] All spill volumes and numbers are for spills of more than 100 kilograms. Due to the rounding of numbers, spill volumes for Nigeria and the rest of the world might not add up to the exact total volume
    of spills.
[I] As of the end of March 2019, there was 1 spill under investigation in Nigeria that may result in adjustments.
[J] All sabotage- and theft-related spills have occurred in Nigeria except in 2016 (0.001 thousand tonnes) and 2015 (0.005 thousand tonnes).
[K] Nigeria includes SPDC onshore operations and SNEPCo offshore operations. A single spill at the Bonga field offshore Nigeria amounted to 4.8 thousand tonnes in 2011.
[L] Nigeria includes SPDC onshore operations (15 operational spills in 2018) and SNEPCo offshore operations (0 operational spills in 2018).
[M] 2017 data reflect 4 spills caused by Hurricane Harvey in the USA.
[N] Freshwater figures do not include once-through cooling water.
[O] In 2018, we sent waste off-site for recycling or reuse, or sold around 400 thousand tonnes of material that would otherwise have been disposed of as waste.

[A] In line with industry standards, we distinguish three contract modes. Mode 1: contractor/supplier performs work under Shell’s HSSE Management System (HSSE MS); Mode 2: contractor/supplier performs
    work under its own HSSE MS, which is materially equivalent to Shell’s HSSE MS; Mode 3: contractor/supplier performs work under its own HSSE MS. Also in line with industry standards, we report on safety
    performance only for contract modes 1 and 2.
[B] Process safety events classified according to guidance from the IOGP and API. In 2018, there were nine Tier 1 sabotage-related events. We did not track the number of Tier 2 sabotage-related events in 2018.
