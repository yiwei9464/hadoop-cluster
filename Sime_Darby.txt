CREATING 
SUSTAINABLE VALUE 
OUR COMMITMENT 
At Sime Darby Berhad (SDB), we believe that in order 
to grow our businesses in a sustainable manner, we 
must balance our commitments to our wide range 
of stakeholders — our shareholders, customers, 
partners, employees and the communities where we 
operate with the goals of our business; delivering 
value, contributing to a better society and minimising 
environmental harm. 
We are focused on developing a portfolio of 
businesses that deliver superior and sustainable 
financial returns for all our stakeholders. 
For details on how we address this, please refer to 
our Value Creation Plan on pages 12 to 13. 
SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE 
To ensure that Sustainability continues to be 
embedded within our business operations, we 
have established a Sustainability function at each 
Division, which reports to the Managing Director of 
the Division. Each Division's Sustainability function 
focuses on sustainability matters that are material to 
each Division. At Group Head Office, material matters 
are reported to the Group Management Committee 
and to the Board as and when necessary. 
Prior to the pure-play exercise, a dedicated Board 
Sustainability Committee, which reported to the 
Main Board, oversaw all sustainability efforts across 
the Group. This was due to the extent and reach 
of the sustainability issues faced particularly by 
the Plantation Division, which had the potential 
to impact the reputation and sustainability of the 
Group. With SDB's new focus on its Industrial and 
Motors Divisions, the Group's sustainability agenda 
and focus have also changed. Today, SDB's Board of 
Directors oversee all sustainability matters directly. 
ANNUAL REPORT 2018 
IDENTIFYING OUR MATERIAL 
SUSTAINABILITY MATTERS 
Prior to the pure-play exercise, Sime Darby Berhad's 
sustainability matters were mainly focused on the 
Plantation business, as it posed the highest risk and 
potential negative impact to the Group. With our 
new focus in the heavy equipment and automotive 
trading segments, we have decided to re-examine the 
material sustainability matters for our organisation, 
to ensure that we continue to address the most 
material issues to the Group and the industries we 
operate in. 
As part of this journey, we have engaged KPMG 
Malaysia to help identify the sustainability matters 
that are material to the Industrial and Motors 
industry segments. 
In consultation with the management team, 
KPMG reviewed a list of applicable sustainability 
matters, compared them to the practices of similar 
companies, reviewed our risk register and identified 
Sustainability Matters that are potentially material to 
the Group. 
We are currently reviewing these Sustainability 
Matters to identify their degree of materiality, both 
from the business perspective and with inputs 
from identified key stakeholders. This will allow us 
to align our strategy and action plans accordingly 
and develop a Sustainability Roadmap that will 
guide the management in monitoring and reporting 
sustainability matters for the Group. 
We aim to identify five key Sustainability Matters that 
are most material to the Group. We will then develop 
plans and initiatives to facilitate measurement of 
our progress and to report our performance in those 
areas. In addition to the Sustainability Roadmap 
at the Group level, we will establish roadmaps to 
address Sustainability Matters that are uniquely 
material to certain businesses and country of

SDB is governed by our Group Policies and Authorities, which are designed to empower management to achieve business objectives 
operations. This will ensure that SDB achieves a balanced 
focus on sustainability, both at the Group level and at 
specific operational or geographical levels. 
For the purpose of reporting for the FY2018 Annual 
Report, we will be focusing on the following sustainability 
matters: 
Business Ethics and Compliance 
Occupational Health and Safety 
Environmental Sustainability 
Employee Development and Engagement 
Fair Employment Practices 
Community Contributions and Development

BUSINESS ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE 
SDB is governed by our Group Policies and Authorities (GPAs), which are 
designed to empower management to achieve business objectives within the 
boundaries of business ethics and with the highest standards of corporate 
governance. The GPAs form a living document and are constantly updated as 
the governance environment and stakeholders' expectations of good practice 
evolve. 
In particular, the GPAs detail the roles and responsibilities of Group Corporate 
Assurance, Group Compliance and Group Risk Management departments, 
and how each function works together to ensure that SDB operates ethically 
and complies with all legal and regulatory requirements, internal policies 
and procedures, standards of good practice (including the Code of Business 
Conduct) and the Corporate Integrity Pledge. 
The GPA Whistleblowing policy was established to provide an internal 
mechanism for reporting, investigation and remedying any breaches related to 
the GPA, COBC and other non-compliances. Read more about Whistleblowing 
at Sime Darby Berhad on our website at http://www.simedarby.com/

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 
The health and safety of our employees, contractors and local 
communities is a top priority and we employ proactive measures to 
prevent accidents and to minimise risks. 
Four focus areas drive our Occupational Health and Safety ("OHS") 
performance: 
Leadership and Commitment 
• 
• 
• 
Improving the visibility of our OHS commitment among 
senior management. 
Incorporating OHS objectives into department targets and 
goals. This includes setting an OHS vision and challenging 
KPIs as well as defining clear responsibilities and authorities. 
Demonstrating a visible commitment to OHS by conducting 
safety programmes and chairing dedicated OHS forums. 
Providing support and resources to OHS personnel. 
Recognising achievements and rewarding good OHS 
performance. 
Implementing OHS reporting systems, including stop-work 
systems, to improve workplace safety. 
Fatality 
In FY2018, we are saddened to report one occupational fatality, 
which involved a contractor working in our Motors Division site in 
Hong Kong. Any fatality is unacceptable and we are determined to 
strengthen our efforts to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Standardised key safety processes have been deployed in the 
Division resulting in a significant improvement in approaches to 
safety communication, safety interactions, incident reporting, 
investigation and risk management. Areas for aligning approaches 
to health and injury management continue to be explored, with a 
focus on early intervention strategies. 
Life-saving commitments were rolled out in a dealership, with 
planning underway to complete deployment across the Division 
in FY2019. This will improve management of workforce exposure 
to critical hazards in the business with the implementation of 
minimum mandatory controls to mitigate risk. Results following 
deployment in this dealership has resulted in a reduction in 
significant incidents reported. 
The Division continues to pursue options to leverage on 
technology to enhance and continuously improve health and 
safety performance. This has seen the deployment of the OCA 
incident reporting software, mobile applications to support risk 
management and hazard reporting. 
SIME DARBY MOTORS LOST TIME 
INJURY AND LOST TIME 
INJURY FREQUENCY RATE 
• LTI and LTIFR for FY2017 restated due to standardised injury classifications 
for Industrial Division. 
In FY2018, LTIFR at the Industrial Division decreased from 2.24 
incidents per million man-hours worked in previous year to 1.87 
incidents per million man-hours. A key component of SDI's health 
and safety strategy and regional plans has involved the deployment 
of standardised incident reporting and injury classification 
standards across the Division. This has resulted in retrospective 
updates being made to injury classifications for lag indicators 
in FY2017 including lost time injuries where evidence of under 
reporting or incorrect classification was identified. 
The Division's priority this financial year has been to continue its 
focus on achieving its goal of No Harm, underpinned by an engaged 
and capable workforce, as well as safe, simple and standardised 
systems and processes. 
Further deployment of the Felt Leadership Programme has 
been central to this, with attendance reaching 35% across the 
Division. The program is built on the premise that all incidents are 
preventable, and it challenges leaders and participants' mindsets 
and behaviours to align with this belief. 
Divisional safety performance has continued to reflect the changing 
safety culture with a significant improvement in lead indicator 
reporting. Safety interactions increased by 39% and hazard 
reporting increased by 79% in FY2018 compared to FY2017.

Motors Division increased its focus on Concerned Positive Reporting 
and received a total of 367 concerns reported from six operating 
countries. The concerns reported included hazard-spotting, unsafe 
acts, unsafe conditions and near misses at key areas of operations. 
The Division will continue to encourage identification of safety risks 
and address gaps before actual occurrence of safety incidents, 
in all countries in which it operates.

Future Focus 
With a leaner structure following the pure-play exercise, we will 
streamline our OHS Management System for all Divisions based 
on best practices in the countries in which we operate. This 
includes greater emphasis on leading indicators such as hazards 
identification and safety interactions conducted in order to prevent 
safety incidents from occurring. 
Sime Darby Berhad remains 
committed to the environmental 
sustainability matters in each of the 
markets we operate in. 
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY 
SDB remains committed to the environmental sustainability matters 
in each of the markets we operate in. 
As part of the ongoing exercise to develop the SDB Sustainability 
Roadmap, we have reviewed the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
list of environmental matters and will be prioritising the following 
three key environmental sustainability matters that are most 
pertinent to our businesses and stakeholders: 
In FY2018, LTIFR at the Logistics Division was reduced from 2.09 
incidents per million man-hours worked in the previous year to 
1.48 incidents per million man-hours. All operating units in the 
Logistics Division will continue its focus on improving management 
competency and employees' awareness on safety through both 
internal and external audits and management review processes. 
Severity Rate 
Another useful indicator that we use to assess the Group's safety 
performance is the Severity Rate, which shows how critical any 
injuries were. The Severity Rate is calculated as the Number of 
Lost Days per 1,000,000 hours worked. In FY2018, Severity Rate 
for the Group was 20.12, which was a significant reduction from 
the previous two years.

Energy & Carbon Management 
Purchased electricity makes up 80% of the Motors Division's 
carbon footprint and 60% of the Industrial Division's. Thus, 
more efforts will be made to minimise electricity consumption 
and to seek out renewable electricity sources. At the moment, 
the Industrial Division's business operations in Australia and 
China have already installed Solar PV systems with the capacity 
to produce up to 178kW of electricity, as part of our efforts to 
promote the use of renewable energy. 
Water Management 
Some of the countries that we operate in, such as China, 
Australia, Singapore and Taiwan are rated as having high 
water risk. 
Our operations, particularly in these markets aim to reduce 
its water consumption through recycling wherever possible. 
Waste & Effluent Management 
This is a top priority for all Divisions as most of the countries 
we operate in have strict regulations on waste and effluent 
management. We will take comprehensive measures to prevent 
environmental pollution and to reduce the amount of hazardous 
and non-hazardous wastes using the latest available technology. 
In the SDB Sustainability Roadmap that is being formulated, we will 
provide details of the initiatives, KPIs and timeline to address the 
above matters. We will also incorporate feedback and ideas from all 
relevant stakeholders in the development of the roadmap.

PEOPLE 
SDB's commitment to delivering a sustainable future goes beyond 
its responsibilities to business and operations. As a corporate 
citizen, our interactions with our stakeholders, especially our 
global team of employees, demand mutual respect and shared 
responsibility. 
Employee Development 
The wellbeing and development of our people are key to the 
growth and success of our organisation, and we value the insights 
and feedback that our employees provide. We prioritise the 
development of leadership capabilities and foster a results-centric 
work environment and a culture that promotes operational 
excellence and efficiency. 
Career opportunities for existing employees are guided by a 
Promotion Policy, which outlines explicit criteria for executive 
promotion. This standardises the process and ensures consistent 
administration across the Group to promote transparency of the 
criteria required to proceed to the next level.

Talent Exchange Programme 
To accelerate talent development, share knowledge across countries and assist with succession planning, Sime Darby Industrial 
implemented the Talent Exchange Programme ("TEP"). In FY2018, we conducted an employee exchange programme, our first ever, 
between Malaysia and China. The programme ran from April 2017 to May 2018, and involved one employee from each country. The 
TEP will be conducted annually and in FY2019, we aim to expand the programme to include Australia. 
Triple Career Path 
The creation of multiple career paths for technicians was a priority for the Motors division in FY2018. In recognising the need to do 
more to retain experienced technicians and offer opportunities for career progression, we have reviewed our operations to identify 
future requirements and outlined potential career pathways. This initiative is expected to reduce attrition rates and position us as an 
employer of choice for technicians. 
Upskill, Reskill at Motors Singapore 
As digitalisation, automation and advances in artificial intelligence increasingly affect the way we work, it is likely that employees will 
need to repeatedly update their skills throughout their careers. In FY2018, Motors Singapore delivered courses to help employees 
acquire digital skills and learn how to adapt to change. Training to prepare supervisors and leaders to manage a digital workforce was 
also provided. This initiative will result in a more analytical workforce that is able to help improve processes and gradually reduce 
manual work. The improved focus on training and development and the implementation of a more streamlined hiring process is also 
expected to bring higher productivity and reduce the attrition rate for experienced technicians. 
Providing Graduate Opportunities through SLIM 
SDB is committed to providing development opportunities to Malaysian graduates under Skim Latihan IMalaysia (SLIM) with the aim 
of enhancing their employability. In FY2018, SDB successfully trained and provided work exposure for more than 200 unemployed 
graduates. Additionally, close to 400 unemployed graduates were recruited for the "SLIM Booster" programme, where they attended 
two-week classroom training consisting of key soft skills and project management. SDB continues to support this programme as part of 
our commitment to develop the next generation of workforce. 
Employee Engagement 
To coincide with the appointment of the new Executive Leadership team in FY2018, our GCEO embarked on a series of employee 
engagement sessions during which he shared his thoughts on the direction of the Group and invited employees to ask questions and 
communicate their views about the future of the organisation. Engagement sessions were held at the Group's operations in Malaysia, 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and China. The Managing Directors of the Industrial, Motors and Logistics divisions also conducted their 
respective engagement sessions with employees throughout FY2018. 
Along with face-to-face engagement sessions, we encourage a two-way flow of information between employees and the leadership team 
via our online employee portal. Updates and information on the Group are provided on the portal and employees are encouraged to leave 
their comments and feedback on the updates. 
Understanding that work and life is now more integrated than ever, in FY2018, we introduced staggered (flexible) working hours for our 
employees at the Group Head Office of Sime Darby Berhad, as well as selected operating units of our Motors Division in Malaysia. We 
recognise the importance of supporting our employees in balancing and integrating their work life and their personal life to ensure that 
they continue to have a fulfilling career with SDB. Flexible hours will hopefully assist them in managing between deliverables at work and 
commitments at home. 
We strive to inculcate a feeling of belonging within SDB and encourage employee unity and a sense of working together to achieve our 
shared goals. Throughout the year, we hosted numerous events to recognise festive seasons and to bring our people together.

Fair Employment Practices 
At SDB, we have built a culture based on the values of Respect & 
Responsibility, Integrity, Excellence and Enterprise. We strive to 
inculcate these values among our present and future employees. 
To help ensure that we continue to attract and retain individuals 
who are aligned to our culture, as well as to ensure fair treatment 
in our recruitment standards, we adhere to the guidelines that are 
outlined in our Recruitment and Selection Policy. The Policy applies 
to our Malaysian businesses and is also used as a point of reference 
for our overseas operations, for as long as it is compliant with their 
respective local labour laws. The Policy guides our recruitment 
process through a systematic approach based on the principles 
of Competition, Objectivity, Transparency, Equal Opportunity, 
Consistency, and Accountability. 
SDB also champions an inclusive culture and an environment 
that fosters harmonious and sustainable relationships. We 
understand that diversity is key to a sustainable future and strive 
to build an inclusive work environment for all our employees. 
We are committed to protecting women and addressing gender 
discrimination within the workforce. Along with aiming to prevent 
and eradicate sexual harassment, our Policy on the Prevention of 
Sexual Harassment at the Workplace also provides a mechanism to 
effectively address complaints of sexual harassment. 
Constructive employee feedback is highly valued and it is against 
this background that we introduced our Grievance Policy in 2010. 
We encourage employees to air their grievances, gather feedback 
and identify amicable solutions, and we remain committed to 
ensuring that our employees are treated fairly and with respect. 
page 66 
To enable all SDB employees, directors, counterparts and business 
partners to report issues of a sensitive nature, we established 
a whistleblowing channel. External parties and employees may 
access the channel via the Sime Darby Berhad corporate website. 
The primary aim of the whistleblowing mechanism is to enable 
individuals to raise genuine concerns without fear of retaliation. 
A Whistleblowing Policy has been embedded in our GPAs to ensure 
compliance. 
Future Focus 
Looking ahead to FY2019 and beyond, we will maintain our focus 
on talent development and drive a culture of performance and 
operational excellence across the Group. Efforts to foster and 
support appropriate behaviours, beliefs and values will also 
continue. 
Another area of focus is on Leadership Development. We launched 
the Accelerated Leaders Programme (ALP) in 2012 for senior level 
talent and subsequently for middle level talent in 2016. We are now 
reviewing and revamping the development of our talent at all levels 
to suit the needs of the organisation moving forward. 
We are also mindful of the importance of employee engagement. 
An engaged workforce is more productive and is more likely to 
demonstrate discretionary effort to achieve the desired level of 
performance. We will undertake a Global Employee Engagement 
Survey (GEES) which was temporarily put on hold due to the 
pure-play exercise. It is timely to gauge the engagement level of our 
employees following the pure-play exercise. We target to conduct 
the GEES in FY2019, 2 years after the last survey.
