     Our environmental impact is guided by our commitment to factor in climate related financial risks and the potential financial impact of such risks to our
     business as well as our stakeholders. We are currently in the process of assessing these risks and opportunities for scenario planning and mitigation
     measures. Meanwhile, the following section outlines some of the key initiatives undertaken to manage our operational impact as well as our pioneering
     sustainable financing efforts.

     We are guided by our Group Credit Risk Policy, which stipulates that companies with high exposure to environmental or social risks are subject to higher
     credit approving authority and / or extra due diligence. In addition, our Energy Management Statement articulates our purpose and objectives of minimising
     our direct environmental impact from our operations.

     Environmental Impact




     Managing our Operational Impact on the Environment
     At CIMB, we are continuously looking for ways to minimise and manage our environmental impact. For instance, we began the ‘managed print services’
     (MPS), mainly to monitor and control organisation wide printing. MPS helps save money and boost productivity, besides ensuring document security.

     In 2017, we continued our efforts to raise awareness through informational posters, interviews with employees printing high volumes, a ‘Think Before You
     Print’ built-in email notification, and even paperless meetings. As a result of these initiatives, as at December 2017, we reduced the overall print volume by
     approximately 40% compared to before MPS. Following this success, we are in the process of rolling-out MPS at regional level.

                                                             Implemented e-Fax (rightfax) solutions at Menara CIMB. The feature allows our employees to

                                                             We migrated 853 suppliers to GEPS – a ‘paperless’ and ‘low-carbon’ solution. With GEPS,
                                                      06     suppliers can interact and transact with us through a seamless online platform, reducing paper

Small Initiatives; Big Impact
In 2017, we sourced Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified paper for the CIMB 2018 Notebooks, which were distributed to clients and partners. This
small initiative in itself promotes green behaviour, inspiring our internal and external stakeholders to be environmentally-friendly and socially-responsible
consumers.

     Green Financing
     The Green Technology Financing Scheme (GTFS), established by the Malaysian Government, promotes investments in green technology. As one of the
     Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs), our role is to provide financing to companies that supply (producers) and utilise (users of) green technology.
     Investment in green technology refers to products, equipment, or systems which satisfy any of the following criteria:

     The projects under GTFS provided an opportunity for us to develop and own a portfolio of emissions-to-energy projects across ASEAN. Similarly, during
     the year, CIMB Thailand disbursed loans and working capital to the tune of THB450 million for financing renewable energy businesses to include biogas,
     biomass, solar and energy power plant.



                WORLD’S LARGEST GREEN, SUSTAINABLE AND RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT SUKUK ISSUANCE

     In 2017, we led Quantum Solar Park (Semenanjung) Sdn Bhd’s (“QSP Semenanjung”) RM1.0 billion Green SRI Sukuk to partially fund three solar
     photovoltaic plants in Malaysia. The projects are expected to be instrumental in helping Malaysia achieve sustainable electricity supply and the reduction of
     carbon emissions in line with the National Renewable Energy Policy and National Green Technology Policy of Malaysia.

     QSP Semenanjung’s Green Bond Framework has received a Dark Green shading – which entail zero emission solutions and governance structures that
     integrate environmental concerns into all activities – from the Center for International Climate Research (CICERO).

   FIRST SRI SUKUK ISSUANCE APPROVED UNDER THE SECURITIES COMMISSION MALAYSIA’S GUIDELINES
              ON ISSUANCE OF PRIVATE DEBT SECURITIES AND SUKUK TO RETAIL INVESTORS

CIMB had successfully arranged Khazanah’s second issuance of RM100.0 million in nominal value Sukuk via Ihsan Sukuk Berhad (“Ihsan”), a special
purpose vehicle. It was issued pursuant to Ihsan’s Sukuk Programme, and consists of a RM95.0 million Non-Retail tranche as well as an RM5.0 million
Exchange Traded Sukuk (“Retail Sukuk Ihsan”) tranche.

The Retail Sukuk Ihsan was also the first ever to be offered via reward crowdfunding platforms, allowing participation from the Malaysian public who want
to contribute to the programme from as low as RM10.

The social impact of this “Pay-for-Success” structure is measured using a set of predetermined Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) which are assessed
over a five-year observation timeframe. The KPIs are evaluated at Year 5 prior to the maturity of the Retail Sukuk Ihsan. If these KPIs are met, the
Sukukholders will forgo 3.18% of the nominal value due under the Sukuk at maturity in return for tax vouchers in recognition of the positive social impact
generated by the Trust Schools Programme. If these KPIs are not met, the Sukukholders will be entitled to the nominal value due under the Sukuk in full at
maturity. The terms of Retail Sukuk Ihsan also allow Sukukholders to waive the principal sum invested at any time during the tenure of the Sukuk.

The proceeds from the issuance will be used to transform schools under Yayasan AMIR’s (“YA”) Trust Schools Programme identified in 2016. YA is a
not-for-profit foundation initiated by Khazanah to improve accessibility to quality education in Malaysia’s government schools through a Public-Private
Partnership with the Ministry of Education.

           SWEPA BAREFOOT SOLAR PROJECT
           We supported SWEPA’s mission to locate and identify rural villages in Sabah with energy constraints to provide sustainable solar power
           for its community. In 2017, we invested RM157,500 in the programme which aims to identify and train rural women to become solar
   01      engineers. As community champions, they install and take ownership for maintaining the solar power infrastructure for households
           in their villages. The initiative targets semi-literate or illiterate Grandmothers, who will remain in their communities and work for their
           welfare. The initiative has been extremely impactful both in terms of empowering women as agents of change, and using renewable
           energy solutions to connect off-grid and rural communities with power, improving their quality of life.




           CONSERVATION BA’KELALAN AND LONG SEMADOH, SARAWAK AND ULU MUDA, KEDAH BY WORLD WIDE FUND FOR

   02      Both programmes focused on water as a natural capital that impacts the livelihood of more than 2 million people living in that area.
           Through CIMB Islamic, we pledged a three-year partnership, with an annual budget of RM500,000 towards food- and water-security
           initiatives. The three-year work plan involves assessing the biological diversity; developing the best mechanism to raise awareness on
           the importance of the area.



           GREEN PRODUCTS FOR GREEN CUSTOMERS
           Our EcoSave-i Savings Account is environmental friendly, with ‘on-line’ and ‘paperless’ features. To promote green behaviour,
           through this account, we pledge 0.2% of the total EcoSave portfolio balance for green environmental initiatives every quarter. As at 31
   03      December 2017, a total of RM314,135 was disbursed to support several environmental initiatives through credible NGOs. For instance,
           the amount allocated to World Wide Fund for Nature Malaysia (WWF) was utilised to advocate for the establishment of a state or
           national park at Fraser’s Hill, Pahang and to promote the consideration of declaring a protected area at Ulu Muda, Kedah.

     Our social impact can be measured by our commitment to the welfare and well-being of our employees as well as the communities where we serve. Our
     ‘people and community’ approach is to empower them with skills that can prepare them for the future and the Fourth Industrial Revolution; gender-balanced
     and needs-based policies to cater to their demanding lifestyles; rewarding careers and benefits to help them meet their financial commitments; access to
     quality education and healthcare to reduce inequalities in society. We believe, CIMB in the community and at workplace is all about shared resources,
     benefits, achievements, and value. It is about empowering people and improving lives. The following section outlines some of the key policies, programmes,
     and areas of impact in both workplace and the community.


                                                   PROMOTING THE SPIRIT OF #teamCIMB
     With around 38,000 employees across ASEAN +7 countries, we are driven            together; and c) recognise each other’s efforts and always back each other
     by values such as diversity and inclusion for continuous growth. As a            up. We successfully cascaded the three critical behaviours of ABC across
     progressive leading bank in the region, our ‘people’ strategy is well-           all levels and locations of our business in the region since 2015. Through
     positioned to meet the emerging challenges of today’s dynamic marketplace        numerous activities, our objective has been to accelerate culture
     including rapid digitalisation. Our efforts are focused on optimising the        transformation and strengthen the spirit of ‘one #teamCIMB’.
     potential of our workforce and workplace, by making sure we future-proof
     our employees. We do this by developing the right skill-sets and behaviour       For instance, we organised two “Culture Days” involving employees
     through innovative learning and development initiatives, alongside the culture   regionwide simultaneously this year. First is the #appleciate day, which is
     transformation process. We also ensure that the evolving needs of our            observed by staff in CIMB offices across the region by distributing fresh
     diverse employees are met adequately, covering critical aspects such as          apples to appreciate colleagues and peers. Second is a #onetwojuice, which

     balance and participation, and green and responsible behaviour.                  brings together our diverse employees irrespective of their language and
                                                                                      background. These symbolic days help promote diversity and inclusion, with
     Our corporate culture continues to drive performance and accelerate growth.      participation from CIMB employees across the region.
     The organisational culture rests on our philosophy of shaping ‘A Better
     CIMB’ (ABC) by encouraging three critical behaviours – a) go the extra mile
     to delight our customers; b) respect each other, engage openly and work


                                 Thriving on Diversity
                                 One of our core values is “Thriving on Diversity” and our strategic workforce planning efforts help foster inclusivity and diversity
                                 for growth. We achieve diversity through merit-based hiring, a selection process that has proven to work for CIMB, based on
                                 our results. In 2017, 55.6% of our total workforce comprised of women, with 41.8% women representation at senior
                                 management level. Also, 20% of the Board positions are held by women, which is closer to our target of 30% by 2020.
           PROMOTING
            DIVERSITY            In keeping with our inclusive approach, we also continue to look for differently-abled talent and high-potential employees with
                                 special needs. To-date, we have hired 14 such employees in Malaysia alone.

                                 We also encourage talent mobility across our key operating markets in ASEAN and beyond, which helps to foster cross-cultural,
                                 and multi-ethnic teams that bring new perspectives and dimensions to enhance workplace productivity.



                                 Introducing Enriching Policies
                                 We strongly believe in creating a nurturing and caring workplace, which will only foster a sense of belonging and a happy,
                                 productive workforce. We are guided by this philosophy when reviewing and introducing our human resource policies; training
                                 and development needs; and the overall cultural transformation programmes and initiatives.

                                 Our new employee policy, which took effect on 18 June 2017, complements CIMB’s existing Staff Rejuvenation Programme,
                                 which allows staff to take up to nine months unpaid leave for personal reasons – including extended maternity/paternity leave
                                 – and maintain their current position or seniority at the bank. Our paternity leave policy also reinforces CIMB’s commitment to
                                 continuously improve employee welfare through gender-balanced policies.
           NURTURING
            PEOPLE
                                 We also introduced innovative policies under the CIMB Workplace Wellness programme, which aims to help our employees
                                 manage their various personal priorities with Flexible Work Arrangements: Flex4Parents offers reduced workweek or flexible
                                 work options for parents with school-going children or those with ailing parents; one month’s paid Paternity Leave for first-time
                                 fathers; Zero-interest Housing Loan for the first five years; and financial assistance for single parents with school-going
                                 children. In Thailand, 100 employees opted for Telecommuting Work Arrangement, which offers 2-3 days work-from-home option
                                 every week for better work-life balance and another 40 employees opted for Staggered Work Hours policy. In Malaysia, we
                                 offered more than RM1.0 million in Staff Sponsorships and Scholarships to support their financial needs in relation to higher
                                 education, family commitments and career aspirations. All these policy-level efforts help build a highly exciting, productive and
                                 inspiring work environment, while supporting different needs of our employees.

We also seek continuous opportunities to improve the workplace productivity through various health and wellness initiatives. In 2017, on occasions such as
the World Heart Day and Mental Health Day amongst others, we raised staff awareness on various health issues and preventive measures through a
regularised EDM. Besides, we also promoted various sports and recreational activities. Similarly, in Thailand, we have 12 staff sports and recreational clubs,
which promote employee team spirit, health and well-being. During the year, 1,577 members of the staff benefitted from an allocation of THB993,968 to
these clubs.

employees upskill and reskill to remain competent and relevant, with the evolving needs of the industry and workplace.

     In August 2017, 30 employees from Malaysia attended the “Living it to the Fullest”, a pre-retirement workshop held in Menara Bumiputra-Commerce. At the
     workshop, experts from Agensi Kaunseling & Pengurusan Kredit (AKPK) shared insights on prudent financial management, emphasising on 4 Ws – Wealth
     Creation, Wealth Accumulation, Wealth Protection and Wealth Distribution. Other invited speakers shared tips and advice on “Retirement Style” and
     “Wellness Matters”, respectively. Some CIMB retirees were also present to share their key ingredients of a successful retirement life, from the aspects of
     financial habits, lifestyle and relationship.

     To help them transition to a ‘Retirement Life’, we also nominate our deserving and loyal CIMB employees for retirement and long-service awards. In 2017,
     across all our business units in Malaysia, we awarded cash value of RM1,213,000 to 366 Long Service Award winners and 23 Retirement Award recipients.

         Contributing to Youth Development

         Preparing Youth for the Jobs of the Future: In partnership with the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation Sdn Bhd (MDEC) and
         SAS Institute, we organised the CIMB Data Science Challenge in 2017. This annual data science competition is to help the
         university students in Malaysia to design solutions for real-life business scenarios. The objective is build a talent pool to
         serve the present and the future needs of the financial services industry.

         Similarly, the CIMB ASEAN Stock Challenge, in its 8th year, was organised to enable aspiring ASEAN students to demonstrate
         their investment and analytical skills in virtual stock trading across five major stock exchanges in the region.

         The winners in both competitions were offered interships with CIMB apart from the cash prizes.

                                        COMPLIANCE AND RISK




     As the banking environment is fast evolving, the need for building and living
     a compliance culture is absolutely critical. In 2017, we initiated efforts to
     engage with CIMB employees across various levels to better understand
     what compliance means to them on the job and what would make
     ‘compliance’ a habit and behaviour rather than a mandated KPI. Towards
     2018, we plan to introduce compliance-culture-building programmes, which
     over time will help mitigate reputational risks.

     Meanwhile, we also revisited our employee communications to rediscover
     ways to improve employee participation, learning and growth. Our
     discussions in 2017 gave birth to ZAC – a CIMB employee icon, who leads
     the way to remind CIMBians of compliant behaviour. The idea is to design
     communications (supported by a fun-to-learn tutorial pack, gamification,
     competitions, and quizzes) that will inspire employees to learn and apply the
     lessons in their everyday work.

     responsibility, we introduced a new policy called Flex4CSR, which allows      spent volunteering for a cause. These two fresh policies are in addition to
     CIMB Group employees to opt for 30 consecutive calendar days of paid          the Foundation’s existing employee-driven CSR initiative called Community
     leave to support any of CIMB Foundation’s projects, with no impact to their   Link, which encourages staff from our branches to bid for funding for CSR
     existing employment tenure and benefits. All confirmed permanent              projects in their respective communities. The idea is also to promote
     employees, with minimum two years of service with CIMB are eligible to        camaraderie amongst CIMBians in addressing social issues and supporting

We fulfil our commitment to serve local communities through CIMB Foundation. In 2017, our initiatives under the Foundation’s key programme, Community
Link, focused on social inclusion (unity, culture and heritage, homes and shelters, sports for differently-abled); health; and education. A total of approximately
RM10.5 million was invested to achieve positive impact in the three areas. Below is the breakdown of our social investments in the region.
