Our Sustainability Report tells only part of our story. 
Its companion piece is our 2017 Annual Review. 
Our growth and our environmental and social 
impact stories are interconnected, and the Annual 
Review and Sustainability Report reflect this—from 
cover to cover. Our Annual Review cover features 
diverse beverages from our consumer-centric brand 
portfolio. Our Sustainability Report cover represents 
the packaging we want to recover, recycle and 
reuse. We will continue to do business the right

The Coca-Cola Company offers 
more than 500 brands and 4,100 
products to people in more than 
200 countries and territories. 
As a total beverage company, 
we bring people drinks that 
make life's everyday moments 
more enjoyable, to create shared 
opportunity for the people and 
communities we call home. 
To give people everywhere more 
of the drinks they want, we're 
adding vitamins, minerals and new 
flavors to some of our classics; 
rethinking many of our recipes to 
reduce sugar without sacrificing 
taste; and bringing people entirely 
new drinks they've never had from 
us. We're also giving people more 
ways to drink less sugar through 
smaller, more convenient packages 
and clear, easy-to-find calorie 
information so they can make 
informed choices. 
Our business' success depends 
on the unparalleled distribution 
capabilities of our nearly 250 
bottling partners, who help us 
reach approximately 27 million 
customer outlets globally. Working 
together, we put more of our 
drinks in more hands faster than 
anyone. 
While growth is important, we 
cannot grow at any cost. We 
believe in doing business the right 
way, not just the easy way. For us, 
that means continuously working 
to reduce our environmental 
impact through programs like 
World Without Waste, providing 
access to clean drinking water, 
supporting women's economic 
empowerment, and strengthening 
local communities. 
This is who we are.

KEY SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS 
Through our Priority Issue Analysis, we identified a list of relevant sustainability topics for the Coca-Cola system. This analysis is intended to help identify issues in the 
evolving context of our business and global trends. The identified priority issues reflect the diverse perspectives of many stakeholders. The inputs are not just from 
within The Coca-Cola Company, but across many organizations, including bottling partners and external stakeholders across the globe. Many of the topics identified 
from the analysis are issues listed as risk factors in The Coca-Cola Company 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

TURNING OUR PASSION FOR 
WHAT PEOPLE WANT INTO 
DRINKS THEY LOVE. 
At The Coca-Cola Company, we're 
evolving to give people around the 
world more of the drinks they want 
and how they want them. We're 
reducing sugar where possible 
without sacrificing taste; bringing 
people new drinks such as tea, juice, 
water and coffee; and providing 
smaller, more convenient package 
sizes to help people drink less sugar.

WORLD WITHOUT WASTE 
WE BELIEVE A WORLD 
WITHOUT WASTE IS POSSIBLE. 
The world has a packaging problem 
which we have a responsibility to 
help solve. We have set a global goal 
to help collect and recycle a bottle 
or can for every one we sell by 2030. 
This goal is the centerpiece of our 
new packaging vision for a World 
Without Waste, which we intend to 
back with a multi-year investment 
that includes ongoing work to make 
our packaging 100 percent recyclable 
globally by 2025.

"When I go hiking in the Himalayas, 
I always collect plastic litter and 
bring it back to the nearest city to 
dispose of it properly. Working for 
Coca-Cola has made me appreciate 
the need to recycle and prevent 
pollution."

"In Brazil, I observed that the 
same recycling organizations were 
receiving investments and support 
from different consumer goods 
companies. To increase results and 
make investments more effective, 
I implemented a new vision of co- 
creation among these companies."

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
WE CAN HAVE A GREATER 
AND MORE SUSTAINABLE 
IMPACT BY WORKING 
WITH A WIDE RANGE OF 
STAKEHOLDERS. 
We believe that consistent and open 
communication with a diverse range 
of stakeholders leads to continuous 
improvement as we deliver against 
our sustainability goals. Our policies 
and programs are only as strong as 
the engagement with the people and 
communities in which we operate. We 
view stakeholder engagement as a 
continuous dialogue, which enables us 
to identify and address potential issues 
proactively and collaboratively.

In 2017, Coca-Cola and five other consumer goods companies in Indonesia joined in a pioneering alliance, PRAISE (Packaging and Recycling 
Alliance for Indonesia Sustainable Environment), to advance plastic waste solutions aligning with the Indonesian government's move toward 
a "circular economy" approach to waste management. Coca-Cola was represented by Triyono Prijosoesilo, Public Affairs and Communications 
Director for Coca-Cola Indonesia (second from left).
