enhancing lives and livelihoods.   IN PROVIDING ELECTRICITY TO COMMUNITIES,
                                   BUT ALSO IN ADOPTING SUSTAINABLE ACTIVITIES
                                   IN OUR OPERATIONS TO IMPROVE SOCIETAL AND
                                   ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES.


                                       We seek to understand our stakeholders, so we may go
                                       beyond their expectations and create long-term shared
                                       value. TNB remains committed to operating in a manner
                                       that is receptive to the needs and expectations of our
                                       people, the communities we serve, and our surrounding
                                       environment.

                                       As TNB moves toward a better and brighter future, we will
                                       continue our quest to provide Malaysia with safe, secure
                                       and reliable energy as part of our contribution to the
                                       nation’s development.

                                       We are at an exciting juncture in redefining the way we do
                                       business to enhance our capabilities to become a world-
                                       class energy player. We seek to expand beyond Malaysian
                                       shores by diversifying our business, with greater focus on
                                       renewable energy. Wherever we operate, we will continue
                                       to contribute to social and economic development, just as
                                       we do here in Malaysia.

                                       The sustainability of our business is integral to our future,
                                       and as a reflection of a greater focus on transparency,
                                       we are publishing our first Sustainability Report titled
                                       Powering Better Brighter Nations. The intent is to provide
                                       stakeholders with deeper insights into our sustainability

    ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS
    Core to TNB’s success is our ability to develop strong and meaningful relationships with our stakeholders. We have various communication channels in
    place for us to foster meaningful conversations with our stakeholders. Our different stakeholder groups provide important feedback to us throughout the
    year.

    Understanding our stakeholders allows us to better respond to their needs and interests. It provides further clarity on what our stakeholders expect to be
    reported and such views are taken into account during our materiality assessment.

     SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

     Sustainability is embedded in our company policies and is intrinsically linked to our business strategy and decisions. It influences our investments, operational
     efficiency programmes, stakeholder engagement and climate risk mitigation efforts, among others.

     Our sustainability initiatives come under the purview of the Sustainability Development Committee (SDC) and TNB Leadership Group (TLG), comprising
     Management executives and chaired by the President/CEO. Their key roles are to review, challenge, evaluate and advise on initiatives related to the
     implementation of ‘Sustainability and Green Energy’ projects to be implemented by TNB, prior to further review by other committees including the Board of
     Directors. Decisions to escalate issues to higher approving authorities are dependent on our Procurement & Policy as well as Limit of Authority guidelines.

     We regularly review our governance structures and update our controls and policies to ensure compliance with regulations, making sure they are relevant and
     in line with industry good practices.

     RESPONSIBLE AND ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES

     To protect the interests of our stakeholders, we remain committed to operate in an ethical, transparent and responsible manner to earn and maintain their
     trust. We comply with all relevant regulations to ensure integrity and good governance by adhering to the Companies Act 2016, Bursa Malaysia Securities
     Berhad (Bursa Malaysia)’s Main Market Listing Requirements and the Securities Commission (SC)’s Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 2012 (MCCG).
     Details of compliance with MCCG and other guidelines are provided in the Governance section within the IAR FY2017. For more information, please refer
     to “Our Governance in Action” section and “Statement of Risk Management and Internal Control” on pages 118 and 144 of our IAR FY2017 respectively.

     Adherence to practices of good governance has strengthen TNB and contributed significantly to our years of growth and success. Today, as we strive to
     position TNB globally, we are aligned to Reimagining TNB. The aim is to ensure that our policies and business practices are ready to meet future regulation,
     as well as adapt and thrive in a more competitive and market-driven environment. Our drive to operate at the highest level of integrity with zero tolerence
     for bribery or corruption is reflected in our Code of Ethics.

     Our business over the years has been defined by our primary responsibility                                                                                         Renewable

     99% as of 2017.

     We see global expansion as a measure to grow our business portfolio
     and build our credibility as a reliable renewable energy developer. We
     have identified opportunities in emerging and developed markets such as
     India, Turkey and the United Kingdom. This has sparked the growth of our
     generation portfolio through strategic foreign acquisitions. To date, we have                                             International Footprint
     acquired significant foreign portfolio of 4,888MW generation capacity                                                     on Generation Portfolio

The Incentive-Based Regulation (IBR) and Imbalance Cost Pass-Through (ICPT) mechanisms are part of the Malaysia Electricity Supply Industry (MESI) reform
initiatives, introduced by the Government to ensure continuous reliability and efficiency of electricity supply and sustainability of the electricity industry. The
implementation of the IBR and ICPT mechanisms has improved transparency and investor confidence, whilst incentivising TNB to deliver reliable and efficient
services at fair price to our customers.

We continue to partner with the Government to educate Malaysians to be more energy efficient. More details can be found on pages 38 - 41 under the
“Partnering with Customers” section.

     EMBRACING RENEWABLE ENERGY

     Together with the Sustainable Energy Development Authority (SEDA),
     TNB administers and manages the implementation of the Feed-in-Tariff
     (FiT) programme mandated under the Renewable Energy Act 2011. This
     programme pays Feed-in Approval Holders (FiAH) a fixed price for their
     electricity as an incentive. This has led to the commissioning of 7,367 FiT
     projects in Peninsular Malaysia with an installed capacity of 379.4MW as
     of July 2017.

     With the solar photovotaic (PV) quota under the FiT programme reaching
     its limit for customers, the Government has introduced the Net Energy
     Metering (NEM) programme. Under this programme, customers can install
     rooftop solar PV systems for their own electricity consumption and sell any
     excess electricity to TNB. The NEM target is to achieve 500MW of installed
     capacity from 2016 to 2020 (450MW from Peninsular Malaysia and 50MW
     from Sabah). This translates to NEM quota of 90MW per year for Peninsular
                                                                                    TNB gained a foothold in the country's first Large Scale Solar (LSS)
     Malaysia in the period of 2016 to 2020.                                        farm through a 50MW project in Kuala Langat, Selangor.

     EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGIES AND INNOVATION
     In the current economic climate in which the financial and environmental costs of energy are increasing, it is imperative to be efficient and environmentally
     conscious. Innovative technologies have proven to be major contributor to manage energy in a more efficient way.

     While adopting efficient technologies in our new developments, we also ensure older plants are properly maintained and where possible, upgraded to
     maintain their efficiency. We have decommissioned inefficient and ageing Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) and Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plants
     and replaced these with more efficient and economical CCGT plants. Our latest CCGT development at the Perai Power Station, runs on the latest gas turbine
     technologies enabling the plant to achieve generation efficiency of up to 60%.



          Ultra-Supercritical Coal Generation and Clean Technology Power Plants

          Our latest coal-fired power plant in Perak, Manjung 4 utilises ultra-supercritical steam generation technology, a gold standard in the industry
          and is the most efficient coal-fired power plant in Southeast Asia. The ultra-supercritical technology refers to the steam generation process for
          plant production at steam pressure and temperature beyond “critical point”, resulting in lower coal consumption, higher efficiency, improved
          operation flexibility and reduced emissions. This technology enables Manjung 4 to operate at an efficiency exceeding 40% and generate more
          energy per unit of coal burned compared to the “subcritical” steam generation technology used by older plants within the complex, namely
          Manjung 1, 2 and 3.




            Manjung 4 & 5 are the first ultra-supercritical coal-fired power plants in Southeast Asia.

Cutting-edge technology and automation

We have in place an Innovation and Technology Plan to enable TNB to shift

development of an Asset Health Index for every asset, with automated monitoring
                                                                                          BY FY2018, TNB’S GRID DIVISION PLANS TO

By utilising predictive analytics software, our Generation Division developed             BEFORE BEING FULLY DEPENDENT ON THIS
its own Intelligent Predictive and Diagnostic Monitoring System. The system               APPLICATION.
enables plant operators to detect symptoms of failure in advance, thus allowing
the operator to take early preventive action.

Drones have been introduced by the Grid Division for substation inspection and
to complement the 500kV overhead lines ground patrolling. A pilot project was
conducted focusing on patrolling and inspection works on 500kV Transmission
Lines (inclusive of Right-Of-Way) and main intake substations. As a result, this
increased visibility of equipment conditions which was previously limited and
reduced the risk exposure to our maintenance staff who previously performed
inspection works manually. Turnaround rate in responding to requests for
inspections has also improved.

For states that do not have 500kV installations, applicators are trained and
familiarised with the drones for verification of rentice clearing works. By FY2018,
plans are in place to equip maintenance offices in each zone with drones to
complement conservative ground patrolling before being fully dependent on this
application.

To support the Grid of the Future initiative, our Distribution Division has embarked
on several key projects that represent a new and broader approach to improve
reliability, service quality and operational efficiency such as:

1    Advanced Metering Infrastructure - that enhance meter reading by
     introducing remote automatic readings and detailed load profile information
     resulting in less time and manpower resources
2    Mobility Solutions - that provide a platform for work efficiency amongst
     field staff
3    Volt-VAr Optimisation - that improves electricity supply quality
4    Geospatial Information System - that provides near-real-time information
     on TNB’s distribution network
5    Distribution Automation - provides real-time management of network
     operations and we intend to equip substations and feeders with this facility      TNB staff doing their maintenance works at one of the power plants.
     in the near future


ASSET OPTIMISATION
TNB was granted ISO 55001 certification, a process of streamlining asset management best practices and processes benchmark to international standards, in
accordance with the British Standards Institutions of the Publicly Available Specification. TNB has a robust system of capturing accurate and up-to-date asset
information, integrating risk management as part of the asset management system, and continuously improving the existing asset and system performance. Besides
being among the pioneers in Southeast Asia to be PAS 55 certified, TNB has a remarkable record of excellence with the achievement of numerous milestones in
operational and corporate performance over the last financial year.

     MITIGATING OUR GHG EMISSIONS
     GHG emissions as a result of human activities has contributed to global warming according to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
     (UNFCCC). Under the Paris Agreement, Malaysia has committed to reduce GHG emissions intensity of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 45% by 2030 in
     relation to 2005 level. This target was set with 35% on unconditional basis and 10% on conditional basis upon receipt of climate finance funding, technology
     transfer and capacity building from developed countries.

     In response, we are committed to better measure and monitor our emissions, with the ultimate objective of reducing our emissions intensity. This is aligned
     with the demand of our stakeholders for greater transparency on our GHG emissions performance as well as growing expectations from them to limit our
     emissions. In our quest to reduce our emissions intensity, our next step entails developing a GHG management framework to drive a more systematic
     management of GHG emissions.

                                                                                                    GHG Emissions Amount*
approximately 29 million tCO2e. Power generation accounted for approximately
98% of the total GHG emissions in FY2016. The GHG emissions intensity for TNB
has been relatively stable in recent years although it varies slightly depending

on the generation mix, which in turn is determined by prevailing fuel prices. GHG                            (tCO2e) FY2016
emissions in the power sector are mainly attributed to the optimal generation
development plan to meet increasing demand.                                                        GHG Emissions Intensity*

     “Tree for a Tree” Programme

     For many years, TNB has been actively planting and replenishing trees
     through our “Tree for a Tree” programme. The idea is more than just to
     counterbalance our carbon emissions and rejuvenate forests; but aims to
     re-green and re-energise urban public areas. The type of trees planted
     were chosen carefully, based on properties such as the ability to filter
     pollutants from waterways and prevent erosion. We have invested a total
     of RM1.23 million in this programme that is carried out together with
     Pertubuhan Pelindung Khazanah Alam Malaysia (PEKA), local authorities,
     TNB staff and communities. To date, we have planted 11,243 trees and
     we will continue our efforts to plant more trees.

Carbon capture and utilisation

As part of our efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, Tenaga Nasional Berhad Research (TNBR) is studying the viability of Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU),
focusing on amine-based absorption and adsorption. Each technology is capable of capturing up to 99% of CO2 from feed source. Complementing this,
TNBR is also envisaging ways to convert the captured CO2 into methane which has numerous chemical uses; or to feed microalgae which, in turn, can be
converted into various bio-products.

Microalgae from the vicinity of our Sultan Azlan Shah power station in Manjung is being cultivated in a closed-system photobioreactor with absorption
capacity up to 430kg of CO2 annually. Meanwhile, we are looking forward towards commercialising our microalgae bio-products.

Restoring the richness of Royal Belum

In 2007, about 117,500 hectares of land surrounding our Temengor
Hydroelectric dam encompassing 33.5% of the catchment area was
gazetted as a protected area under the Royal Belum State Park (RBSP).
RBSP is notable for being home to three different Rafflesia species, all
10 hornbill species found in Malaysia and a number of large mammals
including elephants, tigers and the seladang (Malayan gaur). In recent years,
however, fish stock in the lake has been decreasing along with the number
of mammals visiting the salt lakes, indicating a general degradation of the
ecosystem. Temengor dam was built prior to the introduction of the EIA as a
regulatory requirement in 1987. Although we had no baseline data to gauge
the extent of the environmental deterioration, we are determined to prevent         Royal Belum is notable for being home to three different Rafflesia species.
any further degradation of this natural reserve and to restore the health of the
natural surrounds as far as possible. We are currently assessing the wildlife
in RBSP and developing a comprehensive environmental management plan
to help sustain the flora and fauna.

We have built a mobile pontoon, an observation platform and a boardwalk to
assist researchers, and are also constructing a trail specifically for Rafflesia
observation and monitoring. As we believe the best conservation efforts
involve the participation of local communities, we are also educating the
local community on conservation, especially fish breeding. To date, we
have arranged numerous trips to the Kelah Sanctuaries in Sabah to witness

        TNB CARELINE:
        WORLD-CLASS CONTACT CENTRE (WCCC) JOURNEY
        We have embarked on a WCCC project to implement 87 cross-pillar initiatives for our TNB Careline. The objective is to enhance our customer’s
        experience when interacting with our contact centres. These initiatives serve to increase the level of professionalism at all call centres, including by
        upskilling our personnel when handling complaints and feedbacks. We are also creating greater self-service options for call-in customers.

        In addition, to reduce avoidable call volumes, the system is being upgraded to include features for Outage Announcements, Call-back Assist for
        callers who may not wish to continue waiting in queue and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Self Service that will convey outstanding TNB account
        amounts and payment due dates upon verification.

        With Outsourced Management Services (OMS) on board, it has enabled us to realise new capabilities while improving our performance.
        The achievement post-OMS has improved service level (57% to 88%), lowered call abandonment rate (17% to 5%) and increased agent utilization
        (from 63% to 66%).

        As part of becoming a World Class Contact Centre, the TNB Careline Office in Menara PKNS has incorporated design features and technological
        enhancements which have increased workforce collaboration leading to higher productivity and staff morale.



     Protecting our customer’s and data privacy




      TNB is committed to protecting our consumers data and privacy.



     Gaining and maintaining our customers’ trust means giving priority to respecting their personal data. We do so by adhering to all relevant regulations on
     data privacy and safety. In Malaysia, we are guided by the Privacy Data Protection Act (PDPA) 2010 and have in place a PDPA Policy. Customers may view
     our PDPA Policy online.

     More and more of customers are opting to make payments online. We have therefore implemented the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
     (PCI DSS) to secure the privacy of our customers’ data. Our PCI DSS encompasses security management, policies, procedures, network architecture,
     software design and other critical protective measures. The standard highlights over 100 security controls to be put in place in order to ensure secured
     online customer transactions via credit card.

                              The tagline “Get Home Safe” serves as the foundation of our health and safety initiative, to ensure that everyone who works with us
                              is protected. We continuously carry out safety trainings to nurture a culture of safety. We stand guided by our TNB Safety & Health
                              Policy which encompasses all our operations Group-wide.

     We are in the midst of developing a new system to manage health, safety and environment (HSE) called Health, Safety & Environment Management
     System (HSEMS) to replace the existing Safety Excellence Management System (SEMS) that has been in place since the late nineties. The new HSEMS will
     incorporate occupational health and safety as well as environmental management concepts that were largely missing in SEMS. We have completed 90%
     of the development and expect it to be fully implemented by end of FY2020.

     To date, all of our power plants and the entire Grid Division are OHSAS 18001:2007 certified. As for the Environmental Management System ISO 14001:2015,
     all power plants and the Asset Maintenance Department of the Grid Division are also certified.

      Safety (BBS) programme at the Sultan Azlan Shah Power Station               and follow up with sustaining and reviewing the programme.
      in Manjung (TNBJ), Perak, as part of an overarching Safety Culture
      Improvement (SCI) initiative. The programme, which seeks to
      change the mindset of employees and reinforce safe behaviours,
      led to noticeable improvement in TNBJ’s safety scorecard with a
      significantly reduced number of days taken off due to illness or injury.
      From a Lost Time Injuries (LTI) of 35 days in FY2016, the number
      dropped to 11 days in FY2017 (up to 18 August 2017).

      Following the success of this project, each of our nine power stations
      is developing its own comprehensive BBS programme. In FY2017,
      the power stations underwent four phases of the BBS roll-out which
      resulted in a specifically designed BBS programme for each power
      plant, inclusive of training to effectively implement the programme.           TNB is committed to achieve zero accidents through the
