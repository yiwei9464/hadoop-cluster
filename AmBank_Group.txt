SUSTAINABILITY

At AmBank Group, we are embedding the principles of
                                                                                 The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals
sustainability and Value-based Intermediation (VBI) into
all aspects of our operations. Along with acting in an
environmentally sustainable way, we consider the social
and economic impacts of our activities and ensure that
they are also sustainable.

We adopted a materiality assessment approach to
our Sustainability Statement, which is guided by the
Sustainability Reporting Guide and Toolkits issued                               In line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals that came into effect in
by Bursa Malaysia. We also based our approach on                                 January 2016, AmBank Group is striving to create a sustainable future for its employees,
internationally recognised sustainability frameworks and                         customers, and shareholders as well contributing to a sustainable future for Malaysians.

the mandatory requirements, including OSH induction and safety

International Women’s Day

This year we celebrated the International Women’s Day on 8 March 2017. The international theme - Be Bold for Change – marked a call to celebrate diversity and
our commitment to upholding our values. Each one of us can be a leader within our own spheres of influence by taking bold pragmatic action to encourage
continued camaraderie and diversity in the group. It was a memorable moment for us as it was the first of such celebrations in AmBank Group.

This is in addition to supporting new mothers with the extension of our paid maternity leave to 90 days in 2017.

Age Distribution and Seniority*

AmBank Group has a relatively balanced staff distribution by age and seniority, and 18.6 years is the average length of tenure. All of our employees are valuable to
us and they bring a range of perspectives and skills to the organisation. AmBank Group provides customised personal and professional development programmes
