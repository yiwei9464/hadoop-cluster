Our Sustainability Matters 
REPORT 
We believe that our vision, summed up by our tagline 'Your Choice Bank', can only be achieved with support from our 
stakeholders. Our stakeholders and their inputs are valuable to us and we seek to reach out to them regularly through various 
platforms as part of the usual course of our business in order to understand their concerns. Feedback received both directly and 
indirectly influences the way we derive our material matters. The table below illustrates the concerns raised by our stakeholder 
groups and how we address them:

Matters of interest 
This year, we conducted a structured process to identify our material sustainability matters. Material sustainability matters are 
areas where we have the greatest impact and through which we seek to create shared value. We identified Bank Rakyat's 
sustainability matters by assessing the operating environment and emerging trends affecting the financial services industry, 
as well as conducting benchmarking potential sustainability matters across a broad range of references such as peer reviews 
and the Global Reporting Initiative Standards (GRI Standards). For the purpose of this report, our Sustainability Working Group 
(SWG) led a risk assessment exercise to determine the level of significance of each matter to the Bank. Based on the outcome 
of the risk assessment exercise, Bank Rakyat determined the level of impact of each of the sustainability matters to the business 
(i.e. The Bank). 
We have grouped our material matters into three themes, as shown below. Our performance and measures taken to manage 
these matters are discussed in the next section of this report.

Sustainability Governance 
At present, our sustainability matters 
are managed as part of the usual course 
of business. Our strategic direction 
is set by the Board and each Head of 
Department monitors the performance 
and management of respective risks 
and opportunities. The performance 
of each department is reported to 
the respective Board Committees. At 
year end, information is collated and 
reported to stakeholders through our 
Sustainability Report. Moving forward, 
we would look into formalising our 
sustainability governance and reporting 
structure to better reflect the way we 
manage our areas of impact. 
Responsible Banking 
In order for us to ensure the Bank 
Rakyat's sustainable success, we 
acknowledge the importance of meeting 
the expectations of our stakeholders 
to uphold the highest standards with 
regards to ethical conduct and integrity 
in our operations. Bank Rakyat's 
commitment of being a responsible 
financial services group is extensively 
presented in the following sections 
covering ethics and compliance, 
responsible lending, digitalisation and 
innovation, responsible procurement 
practices, data security and customer 
experience. 
Ethics and Compliance 
As a Development Financial Institution 
(DFI) and Malaysia's largest Islamic 
cooperative bank, we understand 
our responsibility to facilitate national 
development in the most responsible 
manner. Therefore, we acknowledge 
good corporate governance together with 
ethical and compliant business practices 
as the foundation of our business. Our 
actions are underpinned by our six (6) 
corporate cultures of Rajin (Diligent), 
Amanah (Trustworthy), Kompeten 
(Competent), Yakin (Confidence), 
Akhlak Mulia (Exemplary) and Takwa 
(God-consious) or R.A.K.Y.A.T and our 
commitments, prescribed in our policies 
and codes. 
During the Induction Programme, our 
employees are made aware of our 
practices via Our Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics (COBCE). The 
COBCE communicates our policies to 
our employees, including but not limited 
to our gift policy, anti-corruption policy, 
conflict of interest policy and policy on 
political contributions. 
We maintain two independent sources 
in guiding employees to report a 
misconduct: the Progressive Disciplinary 
Handbook and the Whistleblowing Policy. 
The Whistleblowing Policy is publicly 
available to allow parties external to Bank 
Rakyat to understand grievance channels 
available. Employees and third parties are 
encouraged to report any misconduct, 
including, but not limited to, fraud, 
bribery, and abuse of power through 
email to whistle@bankrakyat.com.my in a 
strict and confidential manner. 
Responsible Financing 
As a DFI and the largest Islamic 
cooperative bank in Malaysia, we 
understand the critical role we play in 
supporting the country's development 
plan. We strive to ensure lending 
practices are performed responsibly 
to the benefit of our customers and 
members. In addition to our internal 
policies, our conduct is governed by 
our by-laws, Bank Kerjasama Rakyat 
Malaysia Berhad (Special Provisions) 
Act 1978, the DFI Act 2002, as well 
as the regulations of Bank Negara 
Malaysia. 
In addition, our role as an Islamic financial institution promotes the granting of products and services in compliance with Shariah 
laws. In providing oversight on Shariah matters in relation to the Bank's business and operations, our governance structure 
includes a dedicated Shariah Committee (the Committee). The Committee reviews operational processes to ensure that our 
services and products are Shariah-compliant. 
Our services and products are driven by Malaysia's development plans and agenda. To this end, we offer products and services 
that target key communities in need. Highlights of our key products and services are shown below:

to ensure the Bank complements the 
lifestyle of our members and non-

Responsible Procurement Practices 
We recognise the role we play in 
ensuring our procurement practices 
are ethical and responsible, as well 
as supporting local businesses. Our 
internal processes, policies and 
procedures guide our employees in fair 
procurement and ensure appropriate 
criteria are thoroughly considered when 
selecting suppliers. 
Our COBCE and procedural documents 
guide our procurement staff in ethical 
conduct, including gift policy, facilitation 
payment, and ensuring suppliers' 
practices align with our policies and 
codes, as well as laws and regulations. 
All quotations and tenders submitted 
by suppliers are evaluated on quality 
of goods and services, background 
and experience, competitiveness of 
price and any efforts towards energy 
efficiency or resource conservation. 
We support local suppliers as we 
understand the national economic 
and social impact of supporting local 
entrepreneurs and businesses. 
We will continue to promote responsible 
procurement practices, 
including 
managing our suppliers and supporting 
local procurement. 
Data Security 
Protecting data and information entrusted by customers is paramount to us. We 
uphold our commitment to ensure the privacy and security of data and information 
by continuously working to strengthen our defence against the growing number of 
cyber threats. We have placed a specific focus on strengthening and improving our 
IT infrastructure system, security and governance over the past few years and will 
continue to do so in time to come. 
Our IT infrastructure system is governed by GPP2031T Security Policies and 
Procedures. We understand that maintaining an IT infrastructure that is stable and 
capable of providing reasonable physical, administrative and technical controls over 
sensitive data and information stored in our systems is of utmost importance. This 
year, we continued to invest significantly in our IT infrastructure, allocating a total 
of RM166 million for the implementation of new systems, additional infrastructure, 
maintenance activities and other enhancements. We believe that a capable and 
rightly-skilled internal team is core to safeguarding the privacy and security of our 
customers' and members' data. 
We took an important step to establish an IT Structured Training Framework in 2017, 
encouraging our talent to focus on certification-based trainings in order to keep the 
team abreast of best practices in the IT and security domain. Other measures taken 
to communicate to our employees on IT and cybersecurity issues are as follows: 
To support and drive the innovations and development of our digital products and 
services, we have established the Bank Rakyat Innovation and Technology Centre of 
Excellence Team (BRIT E). This dedicated team is tasked with overseeing innovation 
and research activities regarding Information Technology (IT) and digital services. 
In the near future, we will continue to provide exceptional digital services to our 
customers and members, leveraging several initiatives including new corporate 
internet banking for our corporate customers, enhancing mobile banking 
applications, mobile wallet, real-time payment platforms and agent banking mobile 
applications amongst others, to remain relevant and competitive in the business.

We engage our customers via various platforms, including social media and Public 
Complaint Bureau during which, we obtain comments on areas such as customer 
service experience, feedback on areas of improvement and products or services. 
We listen to our customers and consider their feedback in identifying areas of 
improvement or developing new products. In 201 7, we received 22,814 complaints 
from our customers, which is 23% higher compared to 2016. The increase is 
due to customer awareness on their right to pursue complaints to Bank Negara, 
Ombudsman for Financial Services and Securities Industry Dispute Resolution 
Centre. We managed to resolve each of the complaints made and will continue to 
provide better services to our customers.

SUSTAINABILITY 
Environmental Management 
REPORT 
SUSTAINABILITY 
REPORT 
We are persistently progressive on how we monitor and manage our environmental 
footprint by focusing on our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water and energy 
consumption, and waste management. 
Our office buildings contribute to our overall energy consumption. The Bank Rakyat 
Twin Towers reflect our commitment to monitor and reduce our energy usage. The 
towers have been uniquely designed to maximise energy performance as they are 
installed with glass facades that enable maximum transparency and capture natural 
sunlight. Apart from that, the offices and common areas are cooled by a centralised 
cooling tower system, with temperature transmitters monitoring the building load 
and chilled water flow rate to maximise energy efficiency. In 201 7, we saw a 5% 
reduction in our expenditure on electricity consumption. 
Electricity Usage in KWh at Menara Kembar Bank Rakyat 
Our waste management effort is 
largely directed towards monitoring 
waste generated from paper and IT 
equipment. As our operations move 
towards digitalisation, we have seen 
a great reduction in our paper usage 
as well as increased productivity. The 
e-documents system uses software 
to manage documents more efficiently 
and cost-effectively. The introduction 
of e-forms for claims, leave application, 
purchases of flight tickets among others, 
has also contributed to an increasingly 
paperless environment in Bank Rakyat. 
Apart from that, we also advocate to 
our employees to use paper only when 
it is necessary. 
Community Investment and 
Development 
Contributing to the local community has 
always been important to Bank Rakyat. 
As a responsible bank with a growing 
business, we deem it our obligation to 
support surrounding communities. We 
utilise our resources to provide for areas 
of 
alleviate living standards. 
Bank Rakyat is committed to carrying 
on our business and affairs in a socially 
responsible, sustainable, and meaningful 
way, taking into account ethics, the 
environment and society at large. We 
have in place our GPP 171 Donations/ 
Sponsorship Guidelines that focus our 
commitments and contributions towards 
involving 
education, 
programmes 
children with special needs, Islamic- 
related programmes, 
programmes 
organised by the government, ministry 
or agencies, Malaysia Co-operative 
Societies Commission, and also 
programmes organised by business 
partners, depositors and cooperatives. 
We however do not support any activity, project or event that is related to a political 
group or party, or that is against Bank Rakyat Corporate's Values. 
Yayasan Bank Rakyat (YBR) 
Yayasan Bank Rakyat (YBR) was established to focus on educational funding and 
charity contribution for the local community. We have been actively sponsoring 
education for underprivileged Malaysian citizens, regardless of religion, race and 
background. The foundation also provides financial assistance to the disabled and 
individuals or organisations in need. 
2017 marked the 10-year anniversary of our YBR that has affected many lives and 
will continue to be an integral part of Bank Rakyat's Corporate Social Responsibility 
efforts. In 2017, we funded around 65,000 individuals. 
More information at https://www.yayasanbankrakyat.com.my/ 
#AnakKita 
The Malaysian government have in place various initiatives to elevate the lives of 
people with disabilities and this has been widely accepted by Bank Rakyat. To 
support this effort, we came up with the theme #AnakKita that seeks to engage and 
help children with autism. We hope our activities will not only raise public awareness 
of children with autism but also attract other organisations to join us in aiding these 
children. Our approach towards this is based on four (4) main pillars; 
In 2017, we organised activities to 
create societal awareness amongst 
the society of autism and spent over 
RM900,000 with the involvement of 
over 1 1 ,000 participants.

Turtle Sanctuary Conservation Programme 
In a steadfast mission to preserve and 
conserve our flora and fauna, Bank 
Rakyat launched a project involving 
cooperation between the Terengganu 
State 
Government, 
Fisheries 
Department and Rakyat Holdings. 
This has further strengthened YBR's 
mission in rehabilitating the Geliga Turtle 
Conservation Centre and Teluk Mak Nik 
Beach in Kemaman, Terengganu. The 
conservation programme allocated 
RM350,000 to ensure the continuous 
success of the developing aquaculture 
research and hatchery of turtles. 
Teluk Mak Nik Beach is a focal point for 
turtle spawning which usually begins 
in March and ends in October. This 
location is the third largest landed area 
for Agar turtles and other species in 
Malaysia after Pulau Talang Besar in 
Sarawak and Pulau Selingan in Sabah. 
The inauguration ceremony of the 
Mak Nik Gulf Coast Turtle Hatchery 
Centre and the Sea Coral Propagation 
Programme Report was a result of the 
efforts to protect the coral reefs. Y BR 
conducted the ceremony that was 
held at Kemaman Sands, Terengganu 
and it was officiated by the Chairman 
of the Infrastructure Committee, Public 
Utilities, Energy and Green Technology 
of the State of Terengganu with the 
objective of encouraging the community 
to conserve our wildlife and coral reefs. 
300 people attended the opening 
ceremony, comprising government 
and non-governmental organisations, 
teachers, students and parents in 
support of the programme. 
A monetary contribution of RM50,000 
was also donated to the Kemaman 
District Fisheries for their Terengganu 
Turtle Fund Account to help the cause.

was allocated towards organising this 
tournament. 
In addition to enhancing the involvement 
of students in sports, the tournament 
also focused on the development 
of human capital through sports by 
developing the talent of young athletes 
from the early stages. In 2017, four 
over-performing students were selected 
to be listed to join one of Malaysia's top 
football academies, the Johor Darul 
Ta'zim Football Academy. 
Nuri the Series 
YBR has sponsored promising 
students in furthering their studies 
to develop their passion for the art 
of animation and has given them 
the opportunity to showcase their 
capabilities by involving them in 
the production of a local animated 
series called "Nuri the Series" since 
March 2016. The series is a learning 
medium for children whereby every 
episode inculcates moral values 
such as the importance of saving, 
preserving cultural heritage and 
other beneficial matters that invokes 
the interest of children. 
In 2017Bank Rakyat, through a joint collaboration between KRU Studio and YBR, 
launched "Nuri the Series" with a preview of its first episode. 80 students from 
Sekolah Kebangsaan Permata and 25 Autistic children from Permata Kurnia 
attended the event. 
STUDENT TESTIMONY - ASHDEEQ ANUAR 
Ashdeeq is a former YBR sponsored student who 
graduated with a Diploma in 3D Animation from KRU 
Academy, Cyberjaya. He is currently working at KRU 
Studio in Ipoh, Perak as a '3D Modeling Artist' and was 
involved in the production of the 'Nuri the Series'. 
First of all, I would like to thank our Creator for 
giving me the path and opportunity to study the 
course that I'm passionate about. I also been 
fortunate to be given the sponsorship by YBR so 
that I could pursue my dream to be a 3D Modelling

We also motivate our employees to take the initiative to have discussions with their managers whenever they identify possible areas 
for them to contribute towards increased revenue/profit, reduced costs or otherwise make the Bank more efficient or effective. 
The health and safety of our employees is a priority for Bank Rakyat. To demonstrate 
our commitment to protect the health and safety of our employees, we have in 
place the Bank Rakyat Occupational Safety &Health (OSH) Policy & Manual which 
is communicated and available via the intranet and also displayed at every level 
of Menara Kembar Bank Rakyat and at each of our branches. The Bank has 
established a OSH Unit under the Industrial Relations Department that reports 
directly to the Human Capital Chief Officer in his capacity as Chairman of the OSH 
Main Committee. The OSH Unit serves as a secretariat to the OSH Main Committee 
in preparing the OSH Policy and manuals, followed by monitoring the implementation 
of the policy and manuals and periodic reviews to ensure effectiveness. We were 
the first bank in Malaysia to obtain the OHSAS 18001 :2007 Occupational Health 
and Safety Management System certification as well as MSI 722:2011 Malaysian 
Standard on Occupational Health and Safety Management System. 
To measure the effectiveness of our OSH management, we monitor the safety and 
health performance of our employees. For FYE 2017 , our reported injuries increased 
slightly from the previous year by six cases. This was attributed to the lack of 
compliance with safety procedures when undertaking daily activities. In overcoming 
this, we will look at placing more emphasis on complying with safety procedures. 
We have set a target of reduction of 380/0 in our incident cases in three years. 
We aim to achieve this target by improving the method of OSH promotion and 
introducing BROSH Internal Certification Programme.

This is the process of learning through experience and practice such as on the job training, knowledge 
sharing, projects, assignments, international exposure, acting role, shadowing, etc. 
It is defined as a process of learning through others via coaching and support. It requires a partnership of 
learners and those providing the support to reach the objective of learning. There are variety of strategies 
used such as observation, networking with those with similar function and asking others. Learning could be 
optimised most of the time through feedback by others of how well the individual is performing. 
The formal classroom training for knowledge or technical required is always mistaken as the optimal choice 
of learning for performance. While it only provides a very small percentage of how an individual could be 
good in the job. Other learning avenue of this formal training includes research, reading books, e-learning,

Lifelong Learning 
Continuous change brought about by 
globalisation will surely give an impact 
and pose a challenge to all countries, 
especially developing countries like 
Malaysia. To address this, YBR has 
taken proactive steps in empowering 
the workforce to become competitive 
and advanced by achieving skilled 
and knowledgeable human capital. 
Lifelong learning enables one to acquire 
knowledge and skills in conjunction 
with high-income economy models 
that are capable of integrating the 
potential of young executives to ensure 
the sustainability and relevance of the 
organisation they work for. Ultimately, 
they contribute to the development of 
the nation, enabling it to stay ahead of 
the changing environments. Education 
is not only for the youth; hence, YBR 
has taken the vigorous step of ensuring 
the incessant implementation of lifelong 
learning. 
i. 
Our Lifelong Learning programme, 
established in 2015, is still ongoing 
in collaboration with Universiti Utara 
Malaysia Professional and Continuing 
Education Centre (UUM-PACE). All 
classes are held once a month at Bank 
Rakyat's Twin Towers. This programme 
is aimed at providing opportunities 
for tertiary education, enhancing 
knowledge skills, and applying lifelong 
learning culture regardless of age, and 
is open to Bank Rakyat's employees, 
including its subsidiaries and members. 
YBR also took the initiative towards 
developing 
productive 
workers, 
possessing high-level thinking skills 
and the capacity to use information 
and communication technology (ICT). 
Employees should now be able to 
perform more complex tasks, innovate 
and improve work processes through 
the use of new technology. In the 
direction of human capital development, 
continuous learning is needed to help 
achieve targeted standards. 
During the reporting year, YBR allocated 
RM685,000 to sponsor 19 students 
comprising employees and members of 
Bank Rakyat to further their studies in 
Finance and Islamic Banking.

In an effort to retain employees in an 
organisation, a robust and inclusive 
talent management process is crucial. 
Bank Rakyat place great emphasis in 
meeting the ever changing demands 
of employees and has embarked on a 
Career Conversation initiative. Career 
Conversation is a career discussion 
between an employee and their 
immediate manager where identified 
areas of interest are expressed and 
development plans are identified and 
agreed upon. Career Conversation helps 
the employer understand the employees' 
needs for career development and 
provides encouragement along the way. 
This helps to motivate and accelerate 
Bank Rakyat's employees' learning and 
development. 
Career Conversation is also a means 
of providing an avenue for employees 
to feel appreciated and be heard. It 
creates a culture that encourages career 
management to attract, engage and 
retain the brightest of talents and allow 
a self-directed journey in managing 
their career progression in the long 
run. It also provides an avenue to help 
employees develop new capabilities 
and knowledge while providing longer 
term career growth opportunities. 
In Bank Rakyat, Career Conversation 
is conducted when the performance 
management cycle is concluded. As 
employees have proven their capabilities 
to achieve the organisation's desired 
result, this Career Conversation would 
allow them to realise their potential 
and developmental areas that would 
excel them further in their career. 
Since its implementation, all executive 
level employees of Bank Rakyat have 
gone through this process and have 
their own individual development plan 
which is monitored as part of their 
performance achievement on a yearly 
basis. Subsequent to this exercise, 
other talent such as Talent Potential 
Assessment and Classification of 
Talent, were also implemented in an 
effort to drive the Bank towards a high 
performing and agile organisation. 
Programme: The Islamic Banker (TIB) 
Trainees are be equipped with 
relevant management and soft skills 
competencies through a series of 
development programme by renowned 
trainers such as ICLIF, Excel Minds 
and OBS. The two-year programme 
is divided into three phases of 
development: 
foundation building, 
business appreciation and career 
placement. 
The programme aims to equip trainees 
with comprehensive competencies 
to kickstart their employment journey 
with the Bank. Additionally, trainees 
are also required to participate in one 
CSR initiative anchored by the United 
Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs). 
Upon completion the one-year 
development programme, they are 
expected to become a group of well- 
rounded trainees and have the option 
to work in a preferred business unit 
mapped against their aspiration in 
alignment with the Bank's business 
requirements.
