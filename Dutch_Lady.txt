Of these 17 goals, Dutch Lady Malaysia – and our parent company, RFC – have identified six SDGs that we contribute to.
They are:

           affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy                implementation and revitalise the global partnership
           for all                                                            for sustainable development

BALANCED NUTRITION

As the world population increases, so has the need to
ensure consistent and sustainable provision of quality
nutrition. Our parent company, RFC has this as one of the
four cornerstones of its own CSR priorities – to ensure
sufficient nutritious food to help combat undernourishment
and a shortage of nutrients.

                                                                     Jr NBA training camps

          At Dutch Lady Malaysia, we believe that every child’s growth and development is heavily
         influenced by both nutrition and daily exercise. That is why we advocate that every young
           Malaysian drinks two servings of milk and spends at least an hour on outdoor activities
