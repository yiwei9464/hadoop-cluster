Finance for a
Climate-Resilient Future
Citi’s TCFD Report
About This Report
This report presents information on Citi’s business and operational climate performance and efforts towards implementing
the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, including the climate scenario analyses
that Citi undertook as part of the UN Environment Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) Banking Sector Pilot Project alongside 15
other financial institutions.


This report is just the beginning of our journey to incorporate climate scenario analysis into our overall strategy and
reporting. Climate scenario analysis is a new area for many companies, including Citi, and we expect the methodology and
tools to conduct climate scenario analysis to evolve and improve over time. This report represents an important first step
upon which we will build to deepen our understanding of climate risks and opportunities.

Introduction

Climate change is one of the most critical issues facing
society today. As detailed in the latest Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report, Global
Warming of 1.5°C, climate change is already affecting many
industries and regions globally, and the related impacts are
only expected to increase.
Sustainability — including efforts to address climate            and the sensitivity of our lending portfolios to potential
risks — is a factor in how we do business to support             climate risks. While the efforts described in this report

Financial Disclosures
In December 2015, the G20’s Financial Stability Board (FSB)
appointed the Task Force on Climate-related Financial
Disclosures (TCFD) to recommend a reporting framework
for use by companies to provide investors and other
stakeholders with information relevant to evaluating
climate-related risks and opportunities. The FSB’s purpose
in creating the TCFD was to generate greater understanding
among stakeholders in the financial sector regarding the
potential effects of climate change on global economic
systems through enhanced disclosures. In developing its
recommendations, the TCFD solicited and received input
from various stakeholders, including financial institutions.

As shown in the graphic to the right,
the TCFD does not expect companies to

immediately. Instead, it expects
that companies will evolve in their
understanding of potential climate risks
and opportunities over time and that
climate disclosures will correspondingly
adapt over time.

    flooding. We plan to consider these types of physical
    risks in the future as data becomes available.
•   Citi did not have data to consider damage to assets or
    other secondary impacts.
•   We recognize that some of the simplifying
    assumptions that we used are not representative of
    how physical risks may affect clients. For example,
    most power plants are not fully utilized all of the
    time. If an extreme weather event were to occur, the
    impacts of downtime may be less severe for clients
    that are able to shift production to other facilities. We
    currently do not have data on asset utilization and
    clients’ ability to shift production after an extreme
    weather event, so we assumed any downtime would
    correspond to a one-to-one decline in revenues.
•   We did not consider how insurance may mitigate the
    risks from downtime and the costs of asset damage.
    As damage and losses from climate change increase,
    premiums will likely increase and may even become
    prohibitively expensive. In addition, as risks increase,
    certain policies that exist today may no longer be
    available in the future. Hence, we did not assume
    that insurance would mitigate risks in our physical
    risk analysis.
•   We did not consider clients’ investments in climate
    adaptation measures at their sites and facilities, which
    may reduce or prevent physical risk impacts, as we did
    not have this information.

Changes in climate are already underway and projected
to grow if we do not take actions to reduce emissions.
Significant attention has been paid to emissions reduction
and decarbonization, but climate mitigation and adaptation
are also critical. In addition to helping clients manage
transition risks through financing renewable energy, energy
efficiency and other low-carbon technologies, Citi sees an
opportunity to help clients become more climate resilient
by providing financing solutions for climate adaptation. One
example of a financial product for physical risk is catastrophe
bonds, which help spread the risk of disaster events to
investors and help to raise money in case of a disaster such
as a hurricane. We are committed to engaging with clients to
manage their physical climate risks through investments that
reduce their vulnerabilities to changes in climate.

to climate risks and opportunities and the range of possible
outcomes for risk management and strategic planning.

Looking Forward

Our experience with the UNEP FI pilot gave us important
insights that will help to inform our strategy going forward
into 2019 and beyond. Citi acknowledges the risks
highlighted by the IPCC’s recent Special Report, Global
Warming of 1.5°C, and recognizes the urgent need to keep
warming below 2°C with a goal to limiting it to 1.5°C.
Given this imperative, Citi understands that even though                  second-order impacts, such as impacts on critical

Certain statements in this report may be “forward-looking statements.” These statements are based on management’s
current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. These statements are not guarantees
of future results or occurrences. Actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those included in these
statements due to a variety of factors, including, among others, global socio-demographic and economic trends, energy
prices, technological innovations, climate-related conditions and weather events, legislative and regulatory changes and
other unforeseen events or conditions, and the precautionary statements included in this report and those contained in Citi’s
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Citi
speak only as to the date they are made, and Citi does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the
impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statements were made. In addition, while this
report describes potential future events that may be significant, the significance of those potential events should not be read
as equating to materiality as the concept is used in Citi’s filings with the SEC.
