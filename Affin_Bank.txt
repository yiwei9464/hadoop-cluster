ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS

We are always mindful of the constant need to engage our stakeholders on material issues that impact the business. How we prioritise these issues may
differ from those of our stakeholders and it is essential that we value and understand their needs and perceptions in order to arrive at an optimal balance
that mutually benefits the business, communities and stakeholders alike. We will continue to focus and improve on this important aspect of the business
with a more in-depth approach in engaging the various parties within the realm of our business.

Building on our close relationship with our stakeholders through the years, we have institutionalised various channels to reach out to different parties.
Ours is an ongoing commitment to reinforce relationships while working in tandem with stakeholders to seek out the best possible avenues in addressing
not only current issues affecting our products and services but also being mindful of the future as well.

SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT




Sustainable Community Development

The topics covered under this section touches upon:
•       Community development
•       Environmental sustainability

The society is where the Group draws its customer base from. The Group believes that every
organization should return to the community what it has been able to draw from it. Given that the
Group’s major shareholder is Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera (LTAT), its sustainability initiatives
are much in line with the efforts of helping to improve the well-being of retired and serving armed
forces personnel and their families. There is no expectation of returns from these activities as the
objective is to promote and assist in the education and welfare of the members and children of the
serving and retired Armed Forces personnel who are in need.

The Group has a tradition of contributing to retired and serving Armed Forces personnel and               AFFINBANK Group contributes RM100,000 as
families. In 2017, AFFINBANK continued its yearly contribution of RM3 million cash to Yayasan             ‘Sumbangan Bungkusan Hari Raya Tabung
                                                                                                          Kebajikan Angkatan Tentera’ annually
Warisan Perajurit, a foundation established with LTAT to raise funds to provide scholarships and
education assistance to the children of retired Malaysian Armed Forces and those currently in
service.

In conjunction with the Hari Raya festive celebration, AFFINBANK contributed RM100,000 worth of
gift packages to the Welfare Fund of the Malaysian Armed Forces. The contribution was to show the
Bank’s appreciation and honour for the sacrifices and services of the Malaysian Armed Forces.
