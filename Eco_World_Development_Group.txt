Sustainability is an integral part of our business strategy, which is built on the three pillars of economy, environment and
society. We place our customers and their interests at the heart of our business, and in developing a robust strategy for
sustainable growth that appeals to our key stakeholders, we explore and identify opportunities that create shared value.

                                            To propel us forward in our sustainability journey we have integrated elements of
                                            sustainability into our Quality, Environmental, Health and Safety Policy, which has
                                            now become our Quality, Environmental, Health, Safety and Sustainability Policy.
                                            The policy which has been endorsed by the Board of Directors (“the Board”)
                                            and senior management will be instrumental in ensuring our strategies, plans
                                            and procedures are aligned with our aspirations of sustainable development. The
                                            policy forms a tool to foster an organisational culture that embraces sustainable
                                            development.

           We strive for excellence in all aspects of our operations. This includes consistently delivering unmatched service and
           product quality to our customers, and taking a proactive approach to improve the economic, environmental and
           social well-being of our stakeholders.

           We manage Quality, Environment, Health, Safety and Sustainability effectively by establishing, implementing and
           maintaining a best practice and process oriented integrated management system.

                and processes
           • To adopt an environmentally-responsible approach to prevent, minimise and mitigate environmental, health and
                safety impact of our activities
           • To comply with all applicable legal, environmental, health and safety legislation and requirements
           • To establish an integrated human capital development strategy to recruit, develop and engage employees to drive
                our growth and to provide a safe and healthy work environment for our employees and business partners
           • To continuously engage, communicate and provide relevant training to our employees and business partners to

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS

We recognise the United Nation’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(“SDGs”) that form the pillars of this Agenda. Six out of the 17 SDGs are relevant to our business operations and in this
section, we have elaborated our commitment towards these six(6) goals which include, SDG3 Good Health and Well-Being;
SDG4 Quality Education; SDG5 Gender Equality; SDG8 Decent Work and Economic Growth; SDG9 Industry, Innovation and
Infrastructure; and SDG11 Sustainable Cities and Communities.


In the coming years, we plan to strengthen our commitment to these SDGs by developing measures that would enable us to
benchmark our performance. Our strategy involves examining key activities across our business and prioritising them, with
a view to embed sustainability into mainstream thinking of the organisation and in everything we do.

    GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY


    By establishing a robust governance structure, we are able to operationalise our sustainability strategies across the business
    and monitor its progress. We have developed a three-tier governance structure that captures the voice of top management
    and the relevant departments. While the Board is at the apex of the governance structure, the three councils, namely,
    the Economic Council, Green Council and Social Council form the foundation. The councils are supported by members
    from various departments. The Sustainability Committee (“SC”), led by the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and comprising
    senior management from key business units, plays the role of a steering committee that advises the Board and provides
    strategic direction to the three councils. The councils report their plans and progress to the SC and the SC in turn reports to
    the Board on a half-yearly basis.

As we adopt a holistic approach to business management by upholding the economic, environmental and social (“EES”)
pillars of sustainability, we continue to work closely with our various stakeholders to identify and address sustainability
matters that significantly influence their decision-making. To this end, we are committed to strengthening stakeholder
engagement so that we can better tackle emerging issues and drive change on the ground. We are steadfast in adopting a
multi-stakeholder approach by communicating and collaborating with regulators, our investors, employees, customers and
other relevant stakeholders to strengthen our performance in the context of sustainability in the short-term, medium-term
and long-term.

We believe that sustainability can be achieved by creating shared value and aligning our sustainability efforts with the
interests and expectations of our stakeholders. We interviewed our key external stakeholders to understand their views on
EcoWorld Malaysia’s commitment to sustainability and its impact on their decision-making. Below are excerpts from these
interviews.



                          INVESTOR

                          “EcoWorld Malaysia is a company that is well managed both financially and sustainably, and
                          can easily pass our investment evaluation process that includes those who are committed to
                          corporate sustainability. We consider our investment in EcoWorld Malaysia to be a sustainable
                          and responsible one, as it is well-aligned with our vision to achieve a better future.”

                          CONTRACTOR

                          “EcoWorld Malaysia is a transparent, fair and professional developer with whom we are happy
                          to cooperate and collaborate. They are very attentive and respond in a timely manner to our
                          concerns.


                          The senior management at Inta Bina strongly believe in quality and communicating this
                          emphasis on quality to our workers. We evaluate workers and sub-contractors to ensure they
                          have the same commitment to high product quality delivery. We believe in the effectiveness of
                          training and therefore provide product and quality training to our workers. We are pleased to
                          state that Eco Sanctuary scored 81.83 points in the CONQUAS certification.”

                          CUSTOMER

                          “I am very satisfied with the after sales services provided by EcoWorld. Another thing that
                          makes Eco Spring stand out from other properties is the generous landscape, pedestrian lanes
                          and bicycle paths provided in this property. I also use the bike sharing system provided by
                          EcoWorld to go around the park.”

     MATERIALITY
     ASSESSMENT

     Materiality assessment is crucial for us to identify and prioritise the material matters that have a high impact on the economic,
     social and environmental aspect of our business. This year, we improved our materiality assessment process by assigning
     weightage to the stakeholders according to their respective level of influence on our business operations. We have, however,
     maintained the 12 material sustainability matters that were identified in 2017 as they continue to be indicative of our journey
     to strengthen EcoWorld Malaysia’s sustainability performance. Representatives of the three councils together with the SC
     were involved in the materiality assessment process.

     related risks and opportunities that are embedded throughout our operations.

SUSTAINING
OUR ECONOMY


  Delivering high quality projects to our stakeholders whilst generating sustainable returns
  to our investors and shareholders


As a leading property developer in the country, we strive to strengthen the domestic economy and sustain the economy
into the future while maintaining financial profitability. Our economic sustainability focuses on business efficiency, delivery
of quality products and profitability.


At EcoWorld Malaysia, we create direct and indirect economic benefits for our stakeholders through the following:




                                         Contributing to job creation both directly through employing staff
                                         as well as indirectly through engaging with contractors and suppliers.




                                         Directly supporting community development via charitable
                                         donations and community partnerships throughout the year.




                                         Developing responsible projects and regular engagement
                                         with investors to enable them to make informed decisions regarding
                                         the impacts of their investments.




                                         Demonstrating industry leadership in building efficiency and
                                         sustainability and minimising environmental impacts associated with our
                                         developments.



Apart from the direct economic impact that our business generates, we are mindful of the impact our corporate social
responsibility (“CSR”) programmes create in providing an enduring shared benefit for all involved. Our impetus to support
communities is to improve access to education amongst vulnerable sections of the community.


In 2018, we invested approximately RM5 million in this direction under the aegis of Eco World Foundation. This investment
is to provide underprivileged youth with the opportunity to pursue their studies, thereby improving their chances of
employability and having the necessary qualifications to contribute to the economic development of the country.

     SUSTAINING OUR ECONOMY




     DIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT

     EcoWorld Malaysia is spread across three key economic regions in Malaysia with 20 projects that include townships,
     integrated commercial developments and green business parks. The Group presently has approximately 8,126.4 acres of
     land bank with a total estimated gross development value (“GDV”) of RM87.5 billion.


     During the financial year ended 31 October 2018, the Group achieved RM2.17 billion and RM217 million in revenue and
     profit before tax respectively. The Group’s historical summary of economic performance is disclosed in the 5-Year Financial
     Highlights section of the Annual Report.

     COMMITMENT TO ANTI-CORRUPTION

     We are committed to the highest standard of integrity and maintaining a high standard of accountability in the way we
     conduct our business and operations. We believe that risk management and consolidating information on risks enable
     consistent decision-making across all risk categories and can guide the Group in seizing opportunities, staying a step ahead
     of uncertainty, meeting stakeholder expectations and capturing emerging risks.


     Corruption is prohibited within our Group and everyone does their part in preventing it. To ensure transparency and protect
     our values, we have a Whistleblowing Policy that provides a safe channel for employees to report any suspected misconduct
     within EcoWorld Malaysia. The aim of this Policy is to provide an avenue for employees and others who have serious concerns
     about any suspected misconduct to come forward and voice those concerns. It strives to foster and maintain an environment
     where employees can act appropriately without fear of punishment or unfair treatment and help maintain a safe workplace,
     while protecting the company’s reputation.


     To instil a culture that is corruption-free, our senior management team conducted Code of Conduct and Business Ethics
     roadshows involving all business divisions in August 2018. During the roadshows, senior management emphasised the
     fundamental principles of our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics which has been endorsed by the Board and reminded
     employees to conduct their affairs in an ethical, responsible and transparent manner. In 2018, we had no issues relating to
     corruption. There were no cases of staff dismissal, fines, disciplinary action nor grievances registered on matters relating to
     corruption.


     Every new employee, on their first day at EcoWorld Malaysia is given a briefing and training on EcoWorld Malaysia’s Code
     of Conduct and Business Ethics. Furthermore, the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics is accessible to all employees via
     EcoWorld Linked, our employee portal.


     REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

     Meeting the compliance demands and expectations of our stakeholders requires regular audits, inspections and reporting,
     which we prioritise as it sets the foundation of a healthy and transparent business operation and in effect, reduces incidents
     of non-compliance.


     Non-compliance to laws and regulations could result in the Group being reprimanded or penalised by the relevant authority
     or regulatory body. Therefore, we remain vigilant of the changes and updates made to regulations relating to the Group’s
     business operations. Respective departments within EcoWorld Malaysia are made aware and monitor compliance to
     regulations i.e. formal awareness and training is provided to staff on new regulations.

INVESTING IN THE COMMUNITY

  “Sustainability is about creating a balance between the rate of development and our responsibility to our surrounding
  environment and the community. As land and natural resources become scarce, it is important for us to preserve and
  conserve what we have currently in order to sustain our business for the future.


  Though others may believe the cost will eclipse the benefits, we realise sustainability has become a requisite to long-
  term profitability and creating shared value. Adopting sustainable practices requires the investment of time and financial
  cost, as well as minimising the environmental impact of our business operations. In doing so, we also minimise any
  negative impact our operations may have on the community and environment as well as any resulting reputational risks.”


  Datuk Heah Kok Boon, Chief Financial Officer



EcoWorld Malaysia is committed to investing in the local community to enhance the socio-economic status of the community
while increasing the economic value of the area. The EcoWorld Labs Series and EcoWorld Shuttlebus Services are two
initiatives that have been introduced as the Group’s contribution to the community.


EcoWorld Labs Series


We remain committed to providing long-term economic opportunities to the communities we serve. Our EcoWorld Labs
Series refers to a new concept of lifestyle commercial hubs created within our projects that is aimed at creating opportunities
for local home-grown retail and F&B businesses.


Through the EcoWorld Labs Series, we have created customised commercial spaces that are affordable for lease by upcoming
entrepreneurs to introduce their products and services. The Labs create opportunities for local home-grown retail and F&B
businesses by acting as a testing ground for these entrepreneurs to gauge the commercial feasibility of their businesses
before they decide to venture further. Uniquely housed in recycled and refurbished shipping containers or purpose-built
structures, the lifestyle hub allows us to accelerate the commercial activities in our developments even before the first
homes are handed over to our purchasers. It also allows our customers to envision the future lifestyle of their township in a
meaningful and cost-efficient way. During the year, we have launched the following lifestyle hubs in our projects.

       Impact on the Community
       • The EcoWorld Labs Series targets primarily home-grown local brands, and thus provides local entrepreneurs and
          businesses with a platform to operate and grow their businesses
       • It also serves as a community-centric place that encourages community building and allows for a range of activities
          that connect people from all walks of life
       • It allows us to accelerate the commercial activities in our development
       • It is a unique concept that provides us with a distinctive brand positioning to further enhance the appeal of our
          developments
       • It leverages on and revolutionises the Malaysian collective culture by effectively deploying place-making principles
          in our design and planning process to foster stronger community engagement



     EcoWorld Shuttlebus Services

     As part of our ongoing effort to enhance eco-living in our projects, we started providing free shuttlebus services to improve
     connectivity around Eco Botanic and Eco Ardence for the residents and public where the passengers can commute between
     the township and its surrounding areas.

                                                 Home ownership helps build financial security, and we want to make

                                                 millenials. We launched the Help2Own homeownership plan this year to
                                                 help genuine home buyers who are able to secure a 70% loan from the

                                                 financial institutions, we were able to offer attractive plans that assisted

MANAGING A SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN


  “We have worked with EcoWorld Malaysia for almost four years now. The overall working experience has been more than
  satisfactory as the Group practices fair treatment by putting in place a transparent procurement practice that promotes
  healthy competition among contract bidders. An open tender system is used with well-established selection criteria.
  After submitting our tender, the documents are carefully evaluated by EcoWorld Malaysia and if necessary, follow-up
  meetings are held to discuss details to ensure they have sufficient information to make a decision.”


  Mr Kuan Mun Chyi, Director of Athens Park Sdn Bhd



Our procurement practices are carried out in a fair and
transparent manner. We ensure that all our suppliers and
contractors adhere to our stringent procurement criteria.
Based on our standard operating procedures, only screened
contractors with good track records that are approved by
the Group Contracts Division will be shortlisted and called to
participate in our tender process. Once tenders have been
submitted, a careful review process is undertaken to decide
on the preferred tenderer. Upon completion of the tender
process, the participating contractors will be provided with
the tender evaluation form to highlight any grievances or

     RESILIENT WORKFORCE


       Providing a positive working environment for our employees by creating opportunities for
       growth and development, and encouraging work-life balance


     As a responsible corporate citizen, we comply with the Employment Act 1955, which is in line with the principles of the
     International Labour Organisation Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. This Act covers key aspects
     of employment including but not limited to maternity protection, employee wages and benefits and the prohibition of child
     labour.


     Attracting and retaining talent is a top priority in EcoWorld Malaysia. We provide a platform for our employees to perform
     to the best of their ability and recognise their potential to be leaders. We actively develop, invest in and foster growth
     amongst our employees as we recognise the success and progress of EcoWorld Malaysia is built on the talent and effort of
     our employees.


     TALENT RETENTION

     We believe a productive workforce results from a team of engaged and motivated employees, and therefore we strive to
     incorporate good hiring practices into our business operation. In 2018, EcoWorld Malaysia hired 244 new employees and
     the distribution of this group across age and gender is presented in the graph below.


     In addition to a highly productive workforce, EcoWorld Malaysia benefits from a low turnover rate that saves cost of new
     employee acquisition. The overall employee turnover rate is 11.2% which is generally lower than the turnover rate in the
     property development industry. The graph below shows the employee turnover rate breakdown by gender and age.

We are proud to share that the Group has been recognised by Aon Malaysia for the third consecutive year as one of the
Best Employers in Malaysia. An independent employee opinion survey was conducted from 13 April – 7 May 2018. 940
employees were invited to participate and 817 employees (87%) responded to the employee opinion survey. Scoring an
impressive 96 points in 2018, the four key criteria and initiatives that contributed to our success are highlighted below:

     DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVENESS

     We pride ourselves on having a diverse workforce. We do not tolerate discrimination on the basis of age, gender or ethnicity
     and we are committed to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination for our employees. The breakdown
     of EcoWorld Malaysia’s employees by age and gender within each employment category reflects a gender-balanced and
     age-diverse workforce.

                                                        Our preference for hiring from the local talent pool spurs the local
                                                        economy and increases job opportunities in the Malaysian job market.

                                                        opportunities to experienced and talented locals and because they are

                                                        Malaysia.


     The graph illustrates EcoWorld Malaysia’s employee demographics by age. 36% of our workforce consists of employees
     below 30 years of age and 59% of them fall between the 30 to 50-year bracket. Only 5% of employees are above 50 years
     old.


     The Group hires a significant number of young employees because of their enthusiasm and passion to perform at work, and
     this gives us the opportunity to train them in the EcoWorld work culture. Young talents are more resilient and adaptable to
     the fast-paced internal work environment and organisational culture.


     We provide equal opportunities and foster diversity to qualified individuals that meet the job specifications. In EcoWorld
     Malaysia, the gender composition is quite balanced with 44% of our workforce represented by women and the remaining
     56% by men. There is no distinction between genders with respect to remuneration and career development opportunities.

EcoWorld Malaysia believes that by cultivating an equal opportunity workforce we are able to fully tap into the potential of our
employees. The total employee strength of EcoWorld Malaysia in 2018 was 1,339 and the employee distribution provided
below demonstrates the balance between both genders across all employment categories, especially at management level.
We encourage female leadership in EcoWorld Malaysia and are proud that 49% of our leaders at management level are
women.

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT


   “Orientation programmes are a key part of our hiring process, where the overview of the Group, our business aspirations,
   vision and mission are introduced to new hires. Most importantly, the supervisor-peer programme plays a major role in
   helping new employees assimilate into the Group’s working culture.”


   Ms Angelin Low, Group Talent Management


We believe that the best philosophy to apply is to hire capable and driven individuals and train them. EcoWorld
Malaysia encourages employee training, workshops, and education for all our employees to strengthen our workforce.
New employees undergo orientation programmes to enable them to understand our organisational culture.


The rapid advancement of technology and its use in the property development industry is dynamic. To ensure our employees’
knowledge and skills are abreast with current trends, we conduct in-house training and send our employees for external
training.

     Our training and career development programmes are based on the specific needs of our employees and in line with their
     career progression within the organisation. During the annual performance appraisal sessions, the Performance Manager
     will conduct a ‘career conversation’ with each employee, an essential measure to determine the future of our employees
     and based on the outcome of the discussion, training plans are drawn up for our employees. The average training hours by

     Training programmes conducted by the Group are dependent on the employees and the types of skills we believe would
     facilitate the Group towards sustainable growth and advancement in the property sector. Each training programme caters
     to employees with specific skillsets, for example, technical staff would need to undergo technical-based training to ensure
     that their skills remain relevant.

     PROMOTING WORK-LIFE BALANCE

     Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is not
     only important for employee well-being, but
     it can also improve employee productivity,
     and ultimately performance. We garner loyalty
     from our employees by prioritising the need for
     work-life balance, which has a positive impact
     on their retention and satisfaction, especially
     the millennials.

MAINTAINING A SAFE AND HEALTHY WORKPLACE

We strive to comply with relevant laws and legislations to ensure that health and safety in the workplace are not being
compromised. With the aim of reducing the frequency and severity of incidents, we inculcate safety awareness by providing
safety training and regular safety reviews.

Establishing a Robust Occupational Safety and Health (“OSH”) System


Our health and safety standards and standard operating procedures (“SOP”) apply to all employees, workers and
contractors. Each Business Unit (“BU”) has a competent and qualified safety officer and its own OSH committee to oversee
the safety aspect of the operations. The figure on the next page represents the typical structure of our OSH committees.

     The OSH committees have fortnightly toolbox meetings with the contractor where project safety, progress and quality are

CONTRACTOR MANAGEMENT


  “While we are thorough in our selection of main contractors, it is the responsibility of the main contractor to ensure that
  the right team of sub-contractors is involved in the project. However, we have site supervisors and safety officers, whom
  we empower to issue stop work orders or summonses when they observe safety, security and environment related
  non-compliances. We recognise that by implementing punitive measures for non-compliances, we are able to effectively
  reiterate the importance we place on workplace safety.


  The employment of foreign workers is a matter we do not take lightly and the hiring of legal foreign workers is spelt out
  in our contract with the main contractor. We ensure that at every construction site, we demarcate a conducive space
  for centralised labour quarters (“CLQ”), as well as ensure that there is potable water supply and electricity supply. We
  prioritise the safety of workers not only while at work, but also with regard to their living conditions at site. For instance,
  we provide strict instructions to the workers to cook only in the centralised kitchen and not where they sleep, in order to
  avoid fire hazards. There are regulatory checks and measures such as fogging every two weeks which is the responsibility
  of the contractor, and the Ministry of Health comes on their inspections to check if the contractor is up to mark. Our site
  supervisors and safety officers are very vigilant in monitoring any lapses on the part of the sub-contractor, which in turn
  protects the workers from unwanted harm and disease, and ensures safe and sanitary living conditions.


  Another area that our site supervisors and safety officers check is waste management. We observe best practices when
  it comes to waste management at our sites and enforce the requirement for allocated areas within each project site to
  collect waste.“

ENSURING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION

Brand reputation and customer satisfaction are critical to the sustainability of our business. As a responsible developer,
we keep track of the satisfaction levels of customers by continuously engaging with them. The Customer Complaint Index
(“CCI”) is used to measure and monitor customer feedback. Our commitment to ensuring customer satisfaction is further
demonstrated through the linkage of our employees’ performance KPIs to the CCI as determinant for their remuneration
package.


We conduct customer satisfaction surveys to ensure we are abreast with our customers’ expectations on quality, efficiency,
service, and reliability. We value our customers’ feedback and address any complaints or issues raised in a prompt manner.
The customer satisfaction survey covers four areas, namely Green and Sustainability, EcoWorld Residence Club (“EWRC”),
Sales Administration and Sales & Marketing. Our commitment to achieving high level of customer satisfaction led us to
obtain an overall score of 85.36% for this year’s customer satisfaction survey. The results of our 2018 survey are illustrated
below.

     We interviewed residents to understand their experience of living in EcoWorld properties. Below are some of the highlights
     of the interviews.


        “Our current house is double the size of my previous home, but surprisingly our electricity bill remains more or less the
        same. It shows that the solar water heater really helps in saving our electricity bills. With the solar water heater, we don’t
        need to install a separate water heater in our bathroom. That improves the aesthetics of our bathroom.


        Every week I segregate our waste at home and dispose the segregated waste at the recycling centre provided in the
        precinct. I am very impressed with EcoWorld’s effort of going green. The facilities that they provide are very useful and
        readily accessible, taking into consideration our needs and thereby encouraging us to go green without sacrificing our
        time and comfort. Indirectly, EcoWorld influences us to live a greener lifestyle.


        We are very happy with the whole township, greenery and layout of Eco Botanic. We are impressed that the tree at the
        Eco Botanic roundabout is a native tree that was replanted and is being preserved.”


        Mr and Mrs Tee, married couple who have been staying in Eco Botanic with their 4 children and mother-in-law
        for 6 months



        “Eco Botanic provides an eco-friendly environment with a lot of green features. For example, the rainwater harvesting
        system installed in our house. We love the idea, and use it to water our garden frequently.


        I love cooking, the idea of having an edible garden is a feature that I enjoy very much. In Eco Botanic, we have a small
        garden where we can plant and harvest various herbs.


        Inside our home, it is quite bright during daytime and we don’t need to turn on any lights. The high window panel, the
        high ceiling, the large garden, makes the morning environment very refreshing. We really enjoy the environment and
        design layout here.”

     Eco Business Park I has been named the World Gold Winner of FIABCI World Prix d’Excellence 2018 under the Industrial
     Category. It is designed with the environment in mind. Every unit is integrated with a host of intelligent green features for it
     to be a sustainable and low-carbon footprint industrial park.


     With a well-manicured landscape, 15 acres of open space, a linear park, multiple green lungs, and water-harvesting features,
     Eco Business Park I ensures a pleasant and conducive environment for businesses to operate smoothly, side-by-side with
     nature. The business park is an exemplary industrial spot strategically placed within proximity to major ports, airports,
     railways and highways, providing businesses with good logistic advantage over other hubs. This leads to improved resource
     usage, decreased transportation time, less environmental impact, and ultimately, lowered business operating costs.

     The introduction of the GRP by the Green Council raised the bar for EcoWorld Malaysia in terms of the Group’s environmental
     performance and is in keeping with our reputation as an ‘Eco’ developer. By ensuring our projects place emphasis on
     environmental sustainability, we develop a branding that gives us a competitive edge over our industry peers.


     The Green Council, which was established three years ago, consists of 50 members spearheading EcoWorld Malaysia’s
     Green Agenda and this involves updating the GRP every year. The council is represented by various departments from
     Eco Central, Eco North, Eco South and support divisions.


     RAISING GREEN AWARENESS

     Our responsibility towards environmental stewardship requires raising awareness amongst our employees. The two main
     ways introduced by the Let’s Green Possible Campaign 2018 in order to create green awareness were inter-departmental
     competitions such as the ‘Electricity and Water Savings Challenge’ and initiatives and programmes including but not limited
     to the IDEAS KPI Campaign, online lunch pre-ordering system, EcoWorld Green Office Guide and group wide recycling in
     sales galleries and offices.


     The objectives of the Let’s Green Possible Campaign include:
     •   Instilling a green mind-set among our employees
     •   Incorporating sustainability in the everyday habits of our employees
     •   Inculcating a ‘green and sustainability culture’ in all EcoWorld Malaysia workplaces
     •   Raising green awareness and engaging our employees in the pursuit of EcoWorld Malaysia’s sustainability goals and
         values

Green Office Guide


Part of the initiatives and programmes of the Let’s Green Possible Campaign was the introduction of the EcoWorld Green
Office Guide for the corporate office. Some of the key practices listed down in the guide are as shown below.




    Power Management
    •   Reduce electricity consumption of lighting by retrofitting to LED lights, green office signage that reminds
        staff to switch off lights when not in use and maximise daylight whenever possible
    •   Reduce electricity consumption of air-conditioners by conducting regular maintenance and setting the
        temperature to the optimum temperature (24° C) and reminders to switch off air-conditioners when not in use
    •   Reduce electricity consumption of computers and printers by setting energy-saving features and shutting off
        computers when not in use


    Water Conservation
    •   Install dual-flush toilet system when toilets are up for replacement
    •   Convert to low-flush toilet by placing a 500ml water bottle in the toilet tank


    Indoor Air Quality
    •   Allow ventilation and air circulation by opening doors
    •   Place air cleaning plants in the office


    Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
    •   Reduce, reuse and recycle stationery whenever possible
    •   Reduce paper printing by going digital
    •   Set printer settings to double-sided printing
    •   Check printer settings before printing to eliminate printing errors
    •   Use washable dishware and avoid disposables


    Office Procurement
    •   Purchase and use eco-friendly cleaning supplies, such as biodegradable, non-toxic, petroleum-free dishwashing
        liquid and floor cleaning detergents
    •   Purchase supplies from vendors who follow environmentally sound practices
    •   Purchase photocopier paper, envelopes, paper towels and toilet paper with high post-consumer recycled
        content
    •   Purchase office paper which is Forest Stewardship Council or Programme for the Endorsement of Forest
        Certification certified

     Energy and Water Consumption


     The ‘Electricity and Water Savings Challenge’ was a competition between departments at the corporate office and all
     EcoWorld Malaysia offices to reduce electricity and water consumption. As shown in the graphs below, there has been a
     reducing consumption trend in electricity and water consumption at the HQ from November 2017 to September 2018.

Waste Recycling


At EcoWorld Malaysia headquarters in Setia Alam, we started recording our recyclable waste collection from 15 November
2017 to measure our performance in this area. Up until the end of July 2018, we have recycled 3,068 kg of paper, 128 kg
of plastic, 48 kg of glass and 2 kg of aluminium waste. Furthermore, we have a composting machine at our Setia Alam HQ
which composts food waste at the source, thereby diverting more waste from the landfill. The fertiliser generated from this
process is given to our employees and customers for their own use.


On 1 August 2018, we initiated Group Wide Recycling in all our offices and sales galleries wherein the recyclable waste
collected is sent to an external party for recycling. With this new initiative, we have 35 categories of recyclable waste, including
but not limited to electronics, metal, paper and plastic waste, as well as car batteries. The amount of waste collected for
recycling in August 2018 and September 2018 is 1,985 kg and 1,375 kg respectively.


We have placed two textile recycling bins at our Setia Alam HQ and one at Eco Ardence to collect and recycle old or
damaged clothes, linens, soft toys, belts, shoes and bags. The unwanted clothing will be recycled into cleaning rags,
which are in demand by industries and textiles which are in good condition will be sold as second-hand clothing.

Green Ideas


In 2018, we conducted two instalments of the Green IDEAS
KPI Campaign with the title ‘Green Initiatives Resulting in
Cost Optimisation’ and ‘New Ways to Save Electricity and
Water at Work for Long Term Sustainability’. These two
campaigns were introduced to promote environmental
stewardship and cultivate green innovation among our
employees by giving them recognition and benefits for
sustainability-related ideas.                                                                               Eco Terraces, Penang

     WASTE MANAGEMENT

     Construction Waste

     As a property developer, we strive to reduce the quantity of construction waste going to the landfills from our project sites.
     We are cognizant of the importance of keeping track of our waste data and moving forward we will put in place appropriate
     waste data tracking procedures.


     At our construction sites, we employ project risk personnel as well as safety officers to conduct regular checks on the
     management of construction debris to prevent illegal dumping and ensure proper disposal of the waste at landfills approved
     by Local Authorities by licensed contractors. Our contractors are required to maintain records on the waste disposal receipts
     for periodic inspection.


     A percentage of the construction waste generated at the BBCC project site is recycled. In June and July 2018, we managed
     to recycle and divert 10.52% and 13.33% of BBCC construction waste from the landfill respectively.

STUDENTS AID PROGRAMME: The Eco World Foundation through the Students Aid Programme (“SAP”), provides
financial assistance to underprivileged primary, secondary and tertiary students with the objective of keeping children of all
races in school.


Currently, Eco World Foundation sponsors more than 2,600 students in selected primary schools, more than 300 students
in selected high schools and approximately 39 students who have gone into tertiary education, of which 20 have graduated.


SAP is endorsed by the MoE and students are recommended by our partner schools based on the financial situation of their
families. We conduct scheduled and unscheduled welfare checks on the students, both in schools and in their homes, to
confirm that the funds we allocate are put to appropriate use. This ensures that we give aid to those who are in need and
would benefit the most from our sponsorship.


Assisting the Foundation in conducting these home visits is the Eco World Foundation Volunteers Club (“EWFVC”) which
was launched in 2015. EWFVC is a platform for EcoWorld employees to volunteer and assist the Eco World Foundation to
carry out its activities. Other SAP activities and programmes that EWFVC assists with include the Parent’s Dialogue sessions,
UPSR Motivational Camps and UPSR Excellence Awards. Motivational Camps are organised every year to prepare Standard
6 students for UPSR exams. Over a period of three days, these camps are meant to boost the confidence level of students
by inviting experienced teachers to conduct talks and provide them with guidance. The UPSR Excellence Awards are held
annually to reward and recognise the students for their commendable efforts in overcoming all odds and excelling in their
UPSR exams. This event serves to motivate the students to redouble their efforts to achieve their ambitions and chart a
brighter future for themselves and their families.

     SUKA SOCIETY: We have recently teamed up with SUKA Society, an NGO that aims to create better access to education for
     Orang Asli (indigenous) communities. Eco World Foundation was introduced to SUKA Society via Agensi Inovasi Malaysia
     due to our continuous commitment in providing access to education for those in need.


     We have contributed RM200,000 towards the administration of SUKA Society’s Empowered2Teach project which caters
     to Orang Asli pre-schoolers in 10 remote villages in Kelantan and Pahang. We believe that with education, a child is able
     to grow up having the knowledge and skills to break free from the cycle of poverty and to protect the rights of his or
     her community. In addition to the support SUKA Society provides to Orang Asli children, Orang Asli adults are given the
     opportunity to be trained as teachers in their community with tools, resources and encouragement provided to enable them
     to become leaders for education within their communities.


     Apart from these activities, the Foundation also seeks to help underprivileged Malaysians through counselling, home visits
     and career guidance.

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS

We create opportunities for EcoWorld Malaysia employees to engage with the local community and support different
social causes. One of the assignments given to the participants of the Eco World Leadership Development Programme
(“EWLDP”) is to initiate new and creative community engagement programmes. Participants of EWLDP are given funds to
plan and organise the CSR events. They also organise fundraisers and recruit more volunteers to achieve the objectives of
their programmes.


The volunteer programme creates a bridge between employees and non-profit organisations, encouraging them to organise
community engagement programmes ranging from a single day of volunteering to long-term partnerships with non-profit
organisations. Our future leaders have initiated meaningful community engagement programmes during the reporting
period, some of which are listed in the table below.

     ECOWORLD INTERNSHIP PROGRAMME

     Our priority is to provide opportunities to local graduates to help them recognise their potential and through our internship
     programmes, we have successfully managed to do so. We have two internship programmes running concurrently for
     Malaysian students. One is the flexi-internship which runs between 3 to 6 months depending on the university and the
     other is the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (“TVET”) internship programme which runs for 6 months. Our
     performance for both these programmes in 2018 is described in the table below.

     CONCLUSION
     To survive and thrive in the future, we need to understand the dynamic trends shaping tomorrow, today. Continuously
     improving our economic, environmental and social risks and opportunities are stepping stones that will subsequently
     contribute towards the long-term sustainable development of the Group. The economic, environmental and social aspects
     of EcoWorld Malaysia’s journey to strengthen its sustainability efforts are showcased in this report. In the coming years,
     we intend to build on these efforts and assess which are the most effective in realising our vision for sustainability.
