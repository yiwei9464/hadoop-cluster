  Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards, a globally recognised reporting framework for sustainability, as well as the amendments to Bursa
  Malaysia Securities Berhad Main Market Listing Requirements relating to the Sustainability Statement in Annual Reports. The scope of this statement and the SR
  is the same as previous years, with data covering FY2018 and operations of Maybank Group, unless stated otherwise. We started tracking our progress systematically

          OUR ROLE IN THE COMMUNITY

We empower the communities where we operate through targeted social investments, volunteer efforts, and long-term partnerships. The Group’s community investments
are managed by Maybank Foundation, in line with the priorities set out in our 20/20 Sustainability Plan.

In 2018, we channelled about 1% of net profit to community programmes. We have maintained this level of contribution since 2013. Our community investment for 2018
is approximately RM72.91 million and our community programmes extend across ASEAN. We strive to invest for impact by focusing on education, community empowerment,
arts and culture, environmental diversity, healthy living and disaster relief.

          OUR ROLE AS A RESPONSIBLE FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDER

Economies, societies and the environment are intertwined, and challenges or risks faced by either one can impact the others. We believe Maybank will only thrive if
elements of good governance, innovation, and environmentally-sound management are integrated into our core business.

Digitalisation, access to finance and funding for small businesses that fuel growth and livelihoods remain high on our agenda. We are committed to getting to know our
clients’ businesses and understanding the social and environmental issues faced by the sectors that we work with.
