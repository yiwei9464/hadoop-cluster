                                      This report has been prepared in accordance with
                                      the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards –
                                      Core Option, as well as GRI G4 Financial Services Sector
                                      Disclosures. The GRI Standards are internationally
                                      recognised and provide robust guidance. Their
                                      universal application allows for comparability of
                                      performance. Reference has also been made to the
                                      primary components of sustainability reporting as set
                                      out by the Singapore Exchange’s “Comply or Explain”
                                      requirements for sustainability reporting.

                                      We have adopted a phased approach towards
                                      sustainability reporting. As we move forward,
                                      disclosure on performance and targets will be
                                      further enhanced. We have not sought external
                                      assurance for this reporting period. This report
                                      covers the Environmental, Social and Governance
                                      (ESG) performance of the OCBC Group for the
                                      financial year ended 31 December 2017. Where
                                      applicable, we have included data from previous
                                      financial years for comparison. Our listed subsidiary,

                                      performance separately.

OUR ESG FACTORS


     We conducted our first formal workshop in March 2017 to determine the                         IDENTIFICATION OF ESG FACTORS
     Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors that are material to us.
     The assessment comprised a four-step process guided by GRI Standards.
     For our inaugural Sustainability Report, our Sustainability Council had the
     responsibility of identifying and prioritising ESG factors for reporting.                     ACTIVITIES
     Moving forward, we will consider involving selected external stakeholders,
                                                                                                   A list of ESG factors was identified through:
     in a phased manner, in the assessment of our material ESG factors.

         ENVIRONMENT
WHY WE HAVE ADDITIONALLY DISCLOSED THIS
The environmental impact arising from the operational activities of financial institutions is relatively small, compared to companies
operating within the industrial sector. But we realise that environmental sustainability is of prime importance to Singapore and the
world at large. In this regard, we have decided to additionally disclose our environmental impact despite it not being a material ESG
factor to the Bank.

   consumption, as well as our                S$100,000 annually.

                                                  witnessed 1.5 tonnes of trash collected within two hours – the bulk of it being

                                                  within our premises, was to eliminate the use of plastic bottled water at our

                                                  of branches in Singapore. As a replacement, we now serve water in 100%
                                                  biodegradable cups to our customers and visitors. This simple act has saved an

                                                  will save an estimated 5,000kg of plastic waste annually.

     GREEN MARK PLATINUM STATUS AWARDED TO OUR DATA CENTRE

     In 2017, we completed the construction of a data centre that was certified with the BCA-IMDA Green Mark Platinum
     Award – the highest standard achievable in Singapore. Utilising water-based cooling systems and cold-aisle containment
     technology that significantly reduce the energy required for cooling, as well as a diesel rotary uninterruptible power
     supply system (pictured below) that ensures efficient power usage, the data centre is 30% more energy efficient than
     other standard data centres in Singapore and the rest of the region. The amount of energy saved will result in about
     S$500,000 in cost savings per year.
